            Game Introduction
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
            Predict Color Game is a simple and fun puzzle game designed to challenge players' observation and prediction skills. In this game, players need to predict what the next color will be based on the given patterns and hints. The game is divided into multiple levels, and the difficulty of each level gradually increases, allowing players to improve their skills through continuous challenges.

            Game Rules
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 text-justify mt-4">
            At the start of each level, players will see a pattern of colored squares, each representing a specific color. The player needs to observe the pattern and predict what color will come next based on the hints given. The prompt can be a pattern related to the colors of the previous blocks, such as "repeat", "alternate", "increment", etc. After the player selects the predicted color, they submit their answer. If the answer is correct, the player will advance to the next more challenging level; if the answer is wrong, the player will lose a chance, but can try again.
