<h1>The Ultimate Guide to Playing Rummy</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by players all over the world for centuries. It is a game of skill, strategy, and luck that can be played with 2-6 players. The game is easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master. If you're looking to brush up on your rummy skills or learn how to play for the first time, this guide is for you.</p>

<h2>Rules of Rummy</h2>

A set is three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run is three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table as the draw pile.</p>

<p>Players take turns drawing cards from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discarding a card from their hand. The game continues until a player successfully forms sets or runs with all of their cards and goes out, or until the draw pile runs out and no more moves can be made.</p>
