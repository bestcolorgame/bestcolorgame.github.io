<p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by people all around the world for many years. It is a game that requires skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. Rummy is usually played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the objective of the game is to form sets or runs of cards before your opponents do. There are many different variations of rummy, but the basic rules remain the same.</p>

<h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

<p>To start the game, each player is dealt a certain number of cards (depending on the variation being played). The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile, and the top card is turned face up next to it to start the discard pile. Players take turns drawing cards from the draw or discard pile and then discarding a card from their hand.</p>

<p>The main goal of rummy is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit). Once a player has formed a set or run, they can lay it down on the table. The game continues until one player has gotten rid of all their cards, at which point they are declared the winner.</p>

  <li><strong>Gin Rummy:</strong> In this variation, players aim to form sets and runs to reduce the number of points in their hand.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Rummy 500:</strong> This variation is played with points. Once a player reaches 500 points, the game ends, and the player with the lowest score wins.</li>
</ol>
