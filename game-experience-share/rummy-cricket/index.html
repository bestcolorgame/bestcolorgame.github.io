<h2>How to Play Rummy Cricket:</h2>

<p>Just like in traditional Rummy, the objective of Rummy Cricket is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. However, in Rummy Cricket, these sets and runs are based on cricket-themed categories such as players' names, jersey numbers, teams, and more.</p>

<p>Players can use their knowledge of cricket to create strategic combinations of cards and outwit their opponents. The game can be played with 2-6 players, and the rules can be customized to suit the preferences of the players.</p>

<h2>Rules of Rummy Cricket:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center to form the draw pile.</li>
<li>Players take turns to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discard a card to the discard pile.</li>
<li>Players aim to form sets (three or four of a kind) or runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit).</li>
<li>Cricket-themed categories can be used to form sets and runs, such as creating a set of players from the same team or a run of jersey numbers in ascending order.</li>
<li>The first player to form all their cards into sets and runs declares "Rummy Cricket" and wins the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Benefits of Rummy Cricket:</h2>

<p>Rummy Cricket is not only a fun and engaging game but also offers several benefits for players:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improves strategic thinking and planning skills</li>
<li>Enhances knowledge of cricket and players</li>
<li>Promotes social interaction and friendly competition</li>
