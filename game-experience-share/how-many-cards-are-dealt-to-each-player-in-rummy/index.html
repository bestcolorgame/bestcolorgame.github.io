    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How Many Cards are Dealt to Each Player in Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. One of the key elements of the game is the dealing of cards to each player at the beginning of a round. The number of cards dealt to each player in Rummy can vary depending on the specific variation of the game being played.</p>

    <h2>Common Rummy Variations</h2>

    <p>There are several variations of Rummy that are played, with the most popular ones being Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, and Rummy 500. Each of these variations has its own rules regarding the number of cards that are dealt to each player at the start of a game.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gin Rummy:</strong> In Gin Rummy, each player is typically dealt 10 cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Indian Rummy:</strong> Indian Rummy is usually played with two decks of cards, and each player is dealt 13 cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Rummy 500:</strong> In Rummy 500, each player is dealt 7 cards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Setup</h2>

    <p>Before the cards are dealt, the deck is shuffled thoroughly to ensure randomness. The dealer then deals the appropriate number of cards to each player, usually in a clockwise direction. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center to form the draw pile.</p>

    <h2>Objective of Rummy</h2>

    <p>The objective of Rummy is to form valid sets and sequences of cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The player who first melds all their cards into valid sets and sequences is declared the winner of the round.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Knowing how many cards are dealt to each player in Rummy is essential to understanding the game and developing a winning strategy. Whether you are playing Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, or Rummy 500, the number of cards you start with can greatly influence your gameplay. So, next time you gather with friends and family for a game of Rummy, pay attention to how many cards you receive and use them wisely to outsmart your opponents!</p>
