<h2>Rules of Ultimate Rummy:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards.</li>
    <li>Players take turns drawing a card from the deck or the discard pile and then discarding a card.</li>
    <li>Players must form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit) in order to lay down their cards.</li>
    <li>The game continues until one player runs out of cards or until the deck runs out.</li>
