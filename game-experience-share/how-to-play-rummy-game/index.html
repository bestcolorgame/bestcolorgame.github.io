<h1 style="color: #4CAF50;">How to Play Rummy Game</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. It is a game of skill where the objective is to form sets and runs using the cards in your hand. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play the game:</p>

<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
<p>The objective of Rummy is to form sequences (runs) and sets using the cards in your hand. A sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, while a set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Game</h2>
<p>Rummy is typically played with two decks of standard playing cards and two jokers. Each player is dealt 13 cards, and the remaining cards form the draw pile. The top card from the draw pile is placed face-up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ol>
	<li>On your turn, you can either pick a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
	<li>If you pick a card from the discard pile, you cannot discard that card in the same turn. If you pick from the draw pile, you must discard a card to end your turn.</li>
	<li>The game continues in a clockwise direction with each player drawing and discarding cards to form their sets and runs.</li>
	<li>The first player to form valid sets and runs and declare their hand wins the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Declaring Your Hand</h2>
<p>When you have formed valid sets and runs, you can declare your hand. To declare, you must have at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence (without a joker). You then place your cards on the table and announce that you are declaring your hand.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>The scoring in Rummy is based on the value of the cards remaining in the hands of the players when a player declares their hand. Face cards (J, Q, K) carry a value of 10, while numbered cards carry their face value. The game continues for a pre-decided number of rounds, and the player with the lowest total score at the end of the rounds wins the game.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rummy is a game of skill, strategy, and luck that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. By forming sets and runs with your cards and declaring your hand at the right time, you can outwit your opponents and emerge victorious. So gather your friends and family, shuffle those cards, and enjoy a game of Rummy!</p>
