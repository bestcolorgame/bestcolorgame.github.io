    <h1>Eye Colour Prediction Chart</h1>

    <p>Have you ever wondered what eye colour your child might have or what eye colour you might have in the future? While genetics play a major role in determining eye colour, predicting the exact shade can be tricky. However, there are certain tools and charts that can help give you an idea of the possibilities.</p>

    <h2>How Genetics Influence Eye Colour</h2>

    <p>Eye colour is determined by the amount and distribution of melanin in the iris. The more melanin present, the darker the eye colour. The main genes that influence eye colour are OCA2 and HERC2. These genes come in different variations, and the combination of these variations from each parent determines the child's eye colour.</p>

    <h2>Eye Colour Prediction Chart</h2>

    <p>Below is a simplified eye colour prediction chart that shows the probabilities of different eye colours based on the eye colours of the parents.</p>

    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (10).png" alt="Eye Colour Prediction Chart" style="width: 100%;">

    <h2>Interpreting the Chart</h2>

    <p>The chart shows the possible combinations of eye colours when parents with different eye colours have a child. For example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If both parents have blue eyes, there is a high chance that the child will also have blue eyes.</li>
        <li>If one parent has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes, the child is likely to have brown eyes as brown is dominant over blue.</li>
        <li>If both parents have green eyes, there is a possibility that the child will have green or blue eyes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>

    <p>While the eye colour prediction chart can give you a general idea of the probabilities, it is important to remember that eye colour inheritance is complex and influenced by multiple genes. Environmental factors and gene variations that are not accounted for in the chart can also affect the outcome.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Eye colour prediction can be a fun way to speculate about what eye colour you or your child might have based on genetics. While it is not an exact science, charts like the one above can provide some insight into the possibilities. Remember, the best way to know for sure is to wait and see!</p>
