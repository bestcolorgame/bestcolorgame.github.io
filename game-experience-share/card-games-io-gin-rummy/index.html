<h2>How to Play Gin Rummy</h2>

<p>The objective of Gin Rummy is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand to create the least amount of deadwood points. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, while a run is a sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>Each player is dealt ten cards, and the rest of the deck is placed face down on the table. The players take turns drawing and discarding cards until one player forms all their cards into sets and runs, at which point they can "knock" to end the round.</p>

<h2>Rules of Gin Rummy</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Players can only end the round by knocking if they have 10 or fewer deadwood points in their hand.</li>
	<li>After a player knocks, the opponent can lay off any unmatched cards on the knocking player's sets and runs.</li>
	<li>The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined score, typically 100 points.</li>
</ul>
