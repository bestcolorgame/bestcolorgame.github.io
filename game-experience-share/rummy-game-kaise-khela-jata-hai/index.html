<h1>How to Play Rummy Game</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. The game is easy to learn and can be a lot of fun to play with friends and family. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play rummy:</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Game</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Shuffle the deck of cards thoroughly.</li>
  <li>Deal 13 cards to each player if there are 2-players, and 10 cards each if there are 3-4 players.</li>
  <li>Place the remaining deck face-down on the table to form the draw pile.</li>
  <li>Turn over the top card of the draw pile to start the discard pile.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
<p>The objective of rummy is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and sequences (three or more cards in consecutive order of the same suit). The first player to meld all their cards wins the game.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ol>
  <li>On your turn, you can either pick a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
  <li>If you choose to pick a card from the discard pile, you must also pick up all the cards that were discarded after that card.</li>
  <li>After picking a card, you must discard one card from your hand to the discard pile.</li>
  <li>The game continues clockwise, with each player taking turns to pick and discard cards.</li>
  <li>Try to form sets and sequences with the cards in your hand.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ending the Game</h2>
<p>The game ends when a player melds all their cards into sets and sequences. The other players reveal their cards, and the total value of the cards left in their hand is calculated. The player who melded all their cards wins the game, and the others get points based on the value of the cards left in their hand.</p>

<h2>Tips to Win</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always try to form pure sequences first.</li>
  <li>Keep a close eye on your opponents' moves to guess their sequences.</li>
  <li>Discard high-value cards early in the game to minimize your points in case you lose.</li>
  <li>Be patient and strategic in your gameplay.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rummy is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. It's a great way to spend time with friends and family and can be a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. So shuffle the cards, deal them out, and enjoy a game of rummy!</p>
