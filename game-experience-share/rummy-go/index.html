        <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T202323.528.jpg" alt="Rummy Game">
        <p>Rummy is a popular card game played by people of all ages across the globe. With simple rules and exciting gameplay, Rummy is a great way to spend time with friends and family. The game is all about forming sets or sequences of cards in your hand to declare a win.</p>

        <p>There are many variations of Rummy, but the basic objective remains the same - to form valid sets and sequences. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>
        
        <img src="/images/colorGame/images (94).jpg" alt="Rummy Cards">

        <p>Players are dealt a certain number of cards, depending on the variant being played, and the rest of the cards form the draw pile. Players take turns to pick a card from the draw pile or discard pile and then discard a card from their hand.</p>

        <p>The game continues until a player forms the required sets/sequences and declares a win by discarding their final card. The other players then calculate the points in their hands based on the unformed sets/sequences and the value of the cards remaining in their hands.</p>

        <p>Rummy requires skill, strategy, and a good memory to keep track of the cards that have been picked and discarded. It's a game that challenges your intellect and decision-making abilities while providing hours of entertainment.</p>

        <p>So, gather your friends and family, shuffle the deck, and get ready to enjoy the thrill of Rummy. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player, there's always something new to learn and experience in this timeless card game.</p>
