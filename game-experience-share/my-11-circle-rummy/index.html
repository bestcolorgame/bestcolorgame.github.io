    <h2>How to Play 11 Circle Rummy</h2>

    <p>To play 11 Circle Rummy, you will need two standard decks of 52 playing cards each. Jokers are not used in this game. The objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand and discard them to win the game.</p>

    <p>Each player is dealt 11 cards at the start of the game. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the center to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is placed face-up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

    <p>On their turn, a player must draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. They must then choose a card to discard. The goal is to form sets of three or four cards of the same rank or runs of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <h2>Scoring in 11 Circle Rummy</h2>

    <p>In 11 Circle Rummy, the value of the cards is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Number cards: Face value</li>
        <li>Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings): 10 points each</li>
        <li>Aces: 1 point each</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At the end of each round, players tally up the points of the cards left in their hands. The player who goes out first receives zero points for that round, while the other players add up the points of the cards left in their hands.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>

    <p>The game continues for a pre-determined number of rounds or until a player reaches a set number of points (e.g., 150 points). The player with the lowest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>

    <p>11 Circle Rummy is a fun and engaging card game that is perfect for a family game night or a casual get-together with friends. It combines elements of strategy, luck, and skill, making it a great game for players of all skill levels.</p>
