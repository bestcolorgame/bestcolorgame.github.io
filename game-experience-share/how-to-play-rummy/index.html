    <h1>How to Play Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill and strategy that can be played with 2-6 players. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form sets and sequences of cards.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up the Game:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle the deck of cards and deal 13 cards to each player.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining cards face down on the table to form the draw pile. Turn the top card face up next to the draw pile to start the discard pile.</li>
        <li>The player to the left of the dealer goes first.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>

    <p>On their turn, a player must do the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Draw one card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
        <li>Form sets or sequences with the cards in their hand.</li>
        <li>Discard one card onto the discard pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sets and Sequences:</h3>

    <p>A set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits. A sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, 7♠ 8♠ 9♠ is a sequence.</p>

    <h2>Ending the Game:</h2>

    <p>The game ends when a player successfully forms sets and sequences with all of their cards, and then discards their final card onto the discard pile. The other players must then tally up the points in their hands (using the value of the cards) and add them to their score.</p>

    <h2>Scoring:</h2>

    <p>The winner of the game is the player with the lowest total score at the end of the game. The points for each card are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Number cards are worth their face value.</li>
        <li>Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points each.</li>
        <li>Aces are worth 1 point each.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Winning:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Focus on forming sequences first, as they are more valuable.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the cards your opponents are picking up and discarding.</li>
        <li>Try to confuse your opponents by holding onto cards that you don't need immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Have Fun Playing Rummy!</h2>

    <p>Rummy is a fun and challenging card game that can be enjoyed with friends and family. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, the key to success in Rummy is strategy and skill. So gather your loved ones, shuffle the cards, and enjoy a game of Rummy!</p>
