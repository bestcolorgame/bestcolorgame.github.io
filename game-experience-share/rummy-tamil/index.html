    <p>The game of Rummy is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents do. The game requires skill, strategy, and a good memory to win.</p>

    <p>One of the key aspects of Rummy is the importance of forming valid sets and sequences. A valid set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but of different suits, while a valid sequence is a group of 3 or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order.</p>

    <p>Rummy is not just a game of luck, but also a game of skill and strategy. Players need to constantly analyze their hand, plan their moves, and keep track of the cards that have been discarded by their opponents in order to form winning combinations.</p>
