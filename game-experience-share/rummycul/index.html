    <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T210002.240.jpg" alt="Rummy Card Game">

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a bit of luck that can be played with 2 to 6 players. The game is known for its simple rules and exciting gameplay, making it a favorite pastime for many.</p>

    <p>In Rummy, the objective is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set is made up of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run consists of three or more cards of the same suit in sequential order. Players take turns drawing and discarding cards to improve their hands and form valid combinations.</p>

    <p>One of the most popular variations of Rummy is Indian Rummy, also known as "Paplu" or "13 card Rummy." In this version, each player is dealt 13 cards, and the objective is to form at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence (without a joker), and the remaining can be sequences or sets.</p>

    <p>Rummy is not just a game of luck; it requires skill and strategy to win. Players need to be observant of their opponents' moves, plan their own strategy, and make smart decisions to outwit their rivals. It's a game that challenges the mind and keeps players engaged and entertained for hours.</p>
