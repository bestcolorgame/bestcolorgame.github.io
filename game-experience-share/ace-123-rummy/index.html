    <h2>Rules of the Game:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt 10 cards at the beginning of the game.</li>
        <li>The objective is to form sets and sequences with the cards in hand.</li>

        <li>In Ace 123 Rummy, a set can consist of 3 or 4 cards, while a sequence must have at least 4 cards.</li>
        <li>The game continues with players taking turns to draw a card from the deck or the discard pile, and then discarding a card.</li>
        <li>The first player to form valid sets and sequences with all their cards declares rummy and ends the round.</li>
        <li>The remaining players tally up the points in their hands based on the cards they have not managed to meld.</li>
        <li>The game is played over multiple rounds, and the player with the lowest cumulative score at the end is declared the winner.</li>
