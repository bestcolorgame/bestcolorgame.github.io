<h1>RummyCulture Rules</h1>

<p>RummyCulture is a popular online rummy platform that offers a fun and exciting way to play the classic card game of rummy. To enjoy the game to the fullest, it is essential to understand the rules of RummyCulture. Here are the basic rules you need to know:</p>

<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>

<p>The objective of rummy is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards in your hand. A valid declaration in the game of rummy consists of a minimum of two sequences, of which one must be a pure sequence, and the remaining cards can be used to form sets and sequences.</p>

<h2>Card Arrangement</h2>

<p>A standard deck of 52 cards is used in RummyCulture, and the rank of the cards in the game is as follows: Ace (low), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace (high). The suits - spades, diamonds, clubs, and hearts, have no significance in rummy.</p>

<h2>Dealing the Cards</h2>

<p>Each player is dealt 13 cards at the beginning of the game. The remaining cards form the closed deck, and the top card from the closed deck is placed face-up to start the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>Players take turns to pick a card either from the closed deck or the discard pile and then discard a card to the open pile. The objective is to form valid sets and sequences as quickly as possible. Once a player has formed valid sets and sequences, they can declare and end the game.</p>

<h2>Declaring in Rummy</h2>

<p>To declare in rummy, a player must have at least two sequences, of which one must be a pure sequence (a sequence without a joker). The remaining cards in the hand can be used to form sets and sequences, including impure sequences (sequences with jokers).</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>The winner of the game scores zero points, and the losing players' scores are calculated based on the cards they have in their hand. Face cards (J, Q, K) carry 10 points each, and numbered cards carry their face value. Aces carry 1 point each. The game continues until one of the players reaches the maximum point limit set for the game.</p>

<p>Now that you know the basic rules of RummyCulture, you can enjoy playing this exciting card game online. Remember to practice your skills and strategies to become a better rummy player!</p>
