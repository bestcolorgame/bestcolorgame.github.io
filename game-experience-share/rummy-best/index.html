A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The game starts with each player being dealt a certain number of cards and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Players take turns to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. The game continues in this manner until a player forms sets and sequences with all the cards in their hand and declares "Rummy". The other players then have to tally up the points in their hands based on the cards they are holding.</p>
