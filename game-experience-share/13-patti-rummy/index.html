<h2>How to Play 13 Card Rummy:</h2>

<p>Each player is dealt 13 cards at the beginning of the game. The remaining cards are placed facedown on the table to form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up to start the discard pile. Players take turns to draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card to the discard pile. The objective is to form valid sets and sequences of cards in your hand.</p>

<p>Valid sets can be either a sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, such as 3-4-5 of hearts, or a set of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, such as 5 of hearts, 5 of spades, 5 of clubs. A pure sequence is a sequence without a joker, whereas an impure sequence can have a joker as a wild card. The game continues until a player declares a show by forming valid sets and sequences.</p>
