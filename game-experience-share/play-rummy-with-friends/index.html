<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Play Rummy with Friends</h1>

<p>Rummy is a classic card game that is perfect for a fun game night with friends. Whether you are looking to unwind after a long day or simply want to challenge your friends to a friendly competition, playing rummy can be a great way to bond and have a good time. Here's how you can get started:</p>

<h2>1. Gather your Friends</h2>
<p>The first step to playing rummy with friends is to gather a group of players. Rummy can be played with 2 to 6 players, so make sure to invite enough friends to join in on the fun.</p>

<h2>2. Shuffle and Deal the Cards</h2>
<p>Once you have your group of friends ready to play, shuffle a standard deck of 52 cards and deal out the cards to each player. In rummy, each player is dealt 10 cards if there are 4 or more players, and 13 cards if there are 2 or 3 players.</p>

<h2>3. Understand the Rules</h2>
<p>Make sure that all players understand the rules of rummy before starting the game. The objective of rummy is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set is made up of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>4. Start Playing</h2>
<p>Once everyone is familiar with the rules, the game can begin. Players take turns drawing cards from the deck or the discard pile, and then discarding a card from their hand. The game continues in a clockwise direction until a player successfully forms sets and runs and goes out, or until the deck runs out.</p>

<h2>5. Keep Score</h2>
<p>After a round of rummy is completed, it's time to tally up the scores. In rummy, each card has a point value, and the objective is to have the lowest score at the end of the game. The player who goes out first gets 0 points, while the remaining players count the points of the cards left in their hands.</p>

<h2>6. Enjoy the Fun</h2>
<p>Playing rummy with friends is not just about winning, but also about enjoying the company and having a good time. Make sure to keep the atmosphere light and fun, and enjoy the friendly competition with your friends.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Gather your friends, shuffle the cards, and get ready to play rummy for a memorable game night!</p>
