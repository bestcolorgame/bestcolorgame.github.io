    <h1>How to Play Rummy Card Game</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is easy to learn and fun to play with friends and family. The game is typically played with 2-6 players and a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of Rummy is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand, and eventually, to go out by getting rid of all your cards first.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up the Game</h2>

    <p>Before starting the game, the dealer shuffles the deck and deals a set number of cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card from the draw pile is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>

    <p>During their turn, players have the option to either draw a card from the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile. The goal is to form valid sets or runs of cards in their hand. A set is three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>Once a player has formed valid sets or runs, they can choose to go out by discarding a card onto the discard pile. The other players then have one final turn to try to improve their hands by forming sets or runs.</p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>

    <p>At the end of the game, the player who went out first wins the hand and scores points based on the cards remaining in the other players' hands. Face cards are worth 10 points, aces are worth 1 point, and number cards are worth their face value. The game continues until a player reaches a predetermined score, usually 100 points.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>

    <p>The overall winner of the game is the first player to reach the predetermined score or the player with the highest score when the game is called to end. Rummy is a game of skill and strategy, requiring players to make quick decisions and adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Rummy is a timeless card game that has entertained people for generations. Its simple rules and engaging gameplay make it a popular choice for game nights and gatherings. So gather your friends and family, shuffle the deck, and enjoy a game of Rummy!</p>
