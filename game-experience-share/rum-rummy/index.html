    <h1>Let's Play Rummy!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the exciting world of Rummy, a classic card game that has been a favorite among players for decades. Rummy is a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned player, Rummy offers endless entertainment and opportunities to showcase your skills.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy:</h2>

    <p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, and a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>Each player is dealt a certain number of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. Players take turns to draw cards from the draw pile or the discard pile, which is formed by the players discarding unwanted cards.</p>

    <p>The game continues until a player forms valid sets and sequences with all their cards and declares their hand. The other players then have one final chance to form valid sets and sequences with their remaining cards. The player with the lowest total points in their hand is declared the winner.</p>
