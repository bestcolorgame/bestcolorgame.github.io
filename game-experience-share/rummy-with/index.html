    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Rummy: A Classic Card Game</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a classic card game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. It is a game that is easy to learn but offers a great deal of depth and strategy, making it a favorite among card players worldwide.</p>

    <h2>The Basics of Rummy</h2>

    <p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, while a run is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. Players take turns drawing and discarding cards in an effort to create these sets and runs.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <p>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a set number of cards (usually 10 or 13) and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is then turned face up to start the discard pile.</p>

    <p>On their turn, a player must draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. They then have the option to lay down sets or runs of cards from their hand onto the table. Finally, the player must discard one card onto the discard pile. The game continues in this manner until a player is able to form their entire hand into sets and runs, at which point they can go out and end the round.</p>

    <h2>Strategy and Tips</h2>

    <p>While luck plays a role in Rummy, there is also a great deal of strategy involved. Players must decide which cards to keep and which to discard, while also paying attention to the cards their opponents are picking up and discarding. It is important to try to keep your hand flexible and be prepared to change your strategy as the game progresses.</p>

    <p>Some tips for playing Rummy effectively include keeping track of which cards have been discarded, trying to create runs early in the game, and keeping an eye on your opponents' playing styles. It is also important to pay attention to the wild cards in the deck, as these can be used to complete sets and runs.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Rummy is a timeless card game that offers hours of entertainment and can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels. Whether you are a seasoned card player or new to the game, Rummy is sure to provide hours of fun and excitement. So gather your friends and family, shuffle up a deck of cards, and get ready to enjoy the classic game of Rummy!</p>
