<h1>Rummy 101: A Beginner's Guide</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It's a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. If you're new to rummy and looking to learn how to play, this guide will help you get started.</p>

<h2>What is Rummy?</h2>

<p>Rummy is a card game that is typically played with two to six players. The objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand, and then get rid of your remaining cards by laying them down on the table. The player who gets rid of all their cards first is declared the winner.</p>

<h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

<p>Here are the basic rules of rummy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each player is dealt a set number of cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.</li>
  <li>The remaining cards are placed face-down on the table to form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face-up next to it to start the discard pile.</li>
  <li>On their turn, a player can choose to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
  <li>The player must then try to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit) in their hand.</li>
  <li>Once a player has formed valid sets and runs, they can start laying them down on the table. The game continues until a player goes out by getting rid of all their cards.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to help you improve your rummy game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on forming sets first, as they are easier to achieve than runs.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the cards your opponents pick up and discard, as this can help you determine which cards to keep and which to discard.</li>
  <li>Don't hoard high-value cards in your hand, as they can end up costing you points if your opponent goes out.</li>
  <li>Try to keep track of the cards that have been played, as this can give you an idea of which cards are still in play.</li>
</ul>
