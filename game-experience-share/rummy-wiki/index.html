    <h1>Rummy: A Popular Card Game</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a classic card game that is popular worldwide. It is a game of skill, strategy, and luck that can be played with two to six players. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards in hand to win points. Rummy has many variations, such as Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, and Rummy 500, each with its own set of rules and gameplay.</p>

    <h2>Rules of Rummy:</h2>

    <p>In Rummy, players are dealt a hand of cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face-up next to the draw pile to start the discard pile. Players take turns to draw a card from the draw or discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. The goal is to form valid sets and sequences of cards before your opponents.</p>

    <p>A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, 5♥ 5♦ 5♠ is a set, and 3♦ 4♦ 5♦ is a sequence.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game:</h2>

    <p>The game ends when a player forms valid sets and sequences with all of their cards and declares "Rummy." The other players must then show their hands and add up the points of the cards remaining in their hands. The winner receives zero points, while the other players receive points based on the cards they are holding.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Playing Rummy:</h2>
