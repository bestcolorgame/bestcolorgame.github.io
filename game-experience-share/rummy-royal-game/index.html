<h1>Rummy Royal Game</h1>

<p>Rummy Royal is a popular online multiplayer card game that combines strategy, skill, and luck.

<p>The game is typically played with two to four players, and each player is dealt a hand of cards from a standard deck. Players take turns drawing and discarding cards in order to create valid sets and runs. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is a group of three or more cards of consecutive ranks in the same suit.</p>

<p>One of the unique features of Rummy Royal is the use of jokers, which can be used as wild cards to substitute for any other card in a set or run. This adds an extra level of strategy to the game, as players must decide when to use their jokers to their advantage.</p>

<p>Players can also use the "meld" option in Rummy Royal, where they can lay down valid sets and runs from their hand onto the table. This allows them to score points and free up space in their hand for more cards. The game continues until one player empties their hand by forming valid sets and runs, at which point they are declared the winner.</p>
