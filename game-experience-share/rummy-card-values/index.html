    <h1>Rummy Card Values</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that involves arranging groups of cards in specific sequences or sets. Knowing the value of each card is essential to strategizing and winning at Rummy. Here is a breakdown of the card values in Rummy:</p>

    <h2>Number Cards</h2>
    <p>In Rummy, number cards (2-10) hold their face value. For example, the value of the 2 of Hearts is 2, and the value of the 10 of Clubs is 10.</p>

    <h2>Face Cards</h2>
    <p>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) in Rummy hold a value of 10 each. So, the Jack of Spades, Queen of Diamonds, and King of Clubs are all valued at 10 in the game.</p>

    <h2>Ace</h2>
    <p>The Ace card in Rummy is interesting as it can be used as either a high card (worth 11 points) or a low card (worth 1 point) depending on its strategic value in the player's hand. This versatility adds an exciting element to Rummy gameplay.</p>

    <h2>Jokers</h2>
    <p>In some variations of Rummy, Jokers are used as wild cards that can represent any card in the deck. They hold no specific value on their own but can help players form winning combinations by substituting for other cards.</p>

    <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Let's imagine a scenario where a player holds the 9 of Diamonds, 10 of Hearts, King of Spades, and a Joker. In this case, the total value of the hand would be 29 (9 + 10 + 10), as Jokers take on the value of the cards they are replacing.</p>

    <h2>Strategic Tips</h2>
    <p>Understanding the values of each card in Rummy is crucial for making strategic decisions during the game. Players need to assess the points in their hand, plan their moves based on the cards they hold, and keep track of the cards that have been discarded by opponents to form winning combinations.</p>
