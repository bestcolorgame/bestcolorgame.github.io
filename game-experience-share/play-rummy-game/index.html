    <h1>Let's Play Rummy: A Fun and Exciting Card Game</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill, strategy, and luck that can be played with 2 to 6 players. The game is easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master, making it a timeless favorite for many.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

    <p>In rummy, the objective is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) or runs (three or more cards in sequence of the same suit). Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. Players take turns drawing a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discarding a card from their hand. The game continues until a player forms a valid hand and goes out, or until the draw pile runs out.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Winning at Rummy</h2>

    <p>Winning at rummy requires a combination of skill, strategy, and luck. Here are some tips to improve your chances of winning:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus on forming sets:</strong> Try to form sets early in the game, as they are easier to build than runs.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay attention to the discards:</strong> Keep an eye on the cards that your opponents are discarding, as this can give you clues about their hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage your hand:</strong> Try to keep your hand organized and flexible so that you can adapt to changing game conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Don't rush to go out if it means revealing your hand to your opponents. Sometimes it's better to wait and improve your hand before going out.</li>
    </ul>
