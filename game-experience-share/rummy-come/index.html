<h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

<p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The number of players can vary, but it is commonly played with 2-6 players. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face-down on the table to form the draw pile. The top card from the draw pile is placed face-up next to it to form the discard pile.</p>

<p>Players take turns to draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card to the discard pile. The objective is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and sequences (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit). Once a player has formed valid sets and sequences, they can declare and end the game.</p>
