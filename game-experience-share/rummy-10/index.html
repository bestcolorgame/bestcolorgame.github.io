    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <p>To start the game, each player is dealt 10 cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences with the cards in your hand. A set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The game continues with players taking turns to draw a card from the deck or the discard pile and then discarding a card. The first player to form valid sets and sequences and declare their hand is the winner.</p>

    <h2>Strategy</h2>

    <p>One key strategy in Rummy 10 is to keep an eye on your opponents' moves and try to guess which cards they need. This will help you decide which cards to keep and which ones to discard. It is also important to pay attention to the cards that have been discarded by other players, as this can give you clues about their hand. Additionally, try to form sequences early in the game, as they are harder to change once other players have declared their hands.</p>
