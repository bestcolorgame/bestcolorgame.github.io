    <h1>Rummy Set Rules</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a game of skill and strategy that requires players to form sets or runs of cards. Here are the rules for creating a rummy set:</p>

    <h2>Understanding a Rummy Set</h2>
    <p>In rummy, a set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. For example, a set could be comprised of the 7 of hearts, 7 of diamonds, and 7 of spades. A run, on the other hand, is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, a run could be the 4, 5, and 6 of diamonds.</p>

    <h2>Rules for Creating a Rummy Set</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Players take turns drawing and discarding cards to form sets and runs.</li>
        <li>To create a set, a player must have three or four cards of the same rank from different suits.</li>
        <li>Aces can be used as high or low cards, but cannot be used in a set as both high and low at the same time. For example, a set cannot consist of King-Ace-Two of the same suit.</li>
        <li>Once a player has formed a valid set or run, they can lay it down on the table.</li>
        <li>A player must have a valid set or run in their hand before they can lay down any cards.</li>
        <li>The game continues until a player has no cards left in their hand or the draw pile runs out.</li>
        <li>The player who goes out first wins the game.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Strategies for Creating a Rummy Set</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips for creating winning rummy sets:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to keep your options open by holding onto cards that could be used to form different sets or runs.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to the cards your opponents are picking and discarding to gain insight into their strategies.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of the cards you discard, as you don't want to inadvertently help your opponents.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to pick up cards from the discard pile if they can help you form a set or run.</li>
    </ul>
