    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Exciting World of Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for centuries. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form sets and runs of cards before your opponents do. Rummy is not only entertaining but also helps in improving memory, concentration, and strategic thinking.</p>

    <h2>The Basics of Rummy</h2>

    <p>In Rummy, each player is dealt a certain number of cards and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. The top card from the draw pile is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile. Players take turns to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card to reduce their hand.</p>

A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run is a sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The player who successfully melds all their cards into valid sets and runs declares "Rummy" and wins the game.</p>
