<h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

<p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards and jokers are used as wild cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>Each player is dealt a certain number of cards from the deck, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. Players take turns to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discard a card to reduce their hand. The game continues until a player manages to form valid sets and sequences with their cards and declares "Rummy".</p>
