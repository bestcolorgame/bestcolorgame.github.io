    <h1>How to Play Junglee Rummy</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the world of Junglee Rummy, a popular online card game that combines skill, strategy, and fun! Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, here is a step-by-step guide on how to play Junglee Rummy.</p>

    <h2>1. Setting up the Game:</h2>

    <p>First, visit the Junglee Rummy website or download the mobile app. Sign up for an account and log in to access the game lobby. You can choose from different variations of Rummy like Points Rummy, Pool Rummy, or Deals Rummy.</p>

    <h2>2. Rules of the Game:</h2>

    <p>The objective of Junglee Rummy is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards you are dealt. A valid set is three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, and a valid sequence is three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The game is played with two decks of cards and two jokers.</p>

    <h2>3. Gameplay:</h2>

    <p>Each player is dealt 13 cards, and the remaining cards form the closed deck. Players take turns to pick a card from either the closed deck or the open deck (top card placed face-up) and then discard a card to the open deck. The game continues until a player declares by forming valid sets and sequences.</p>

    <h2>4. Declare and Show:</h2>

    <p>When you have formed valid sets and sequences, you can choose to declare your hand. The software will automatically verify your hand, and if it is a winning hand, you win the game. Make sure to arrange your cards properly before declaring to avoid any errors.</p>

    <h2>5. Scoring:</h2>

    <p>Points are calculated based on the cards remaining in the losing player's hand. A pure sequence (without a joker) is mandatory to declare, and its value is zero. Other sets and sequences are assigned point values, and the player with the lowest points at the end of the game wins.</p>

    <h2>6. Practice and Improve:</h2>

    <p>Like any skill-based game, practice is key to improving your Junglee Rummy skills. Play practice games or join tournaments to sharpen your strategies and techniques. Learn from experienced players and observe their gameplay to enhance your own.</p>
