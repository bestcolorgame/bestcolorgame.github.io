<h1 style="text-align: center;">Royal Rummy Card Game Rules</h1>

<p>Royal Rummy is a popular variation of the classic rummy card game that adds a royal twist to the gameplay. It is a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and is suitable for 2 to 6 players.</p>

<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>

<p>The objective of Royal Rummy is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in your hand by forming sets and sequences. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Before the game begins, the dealer shuffles the deck and deals each player a hand of 13 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is then turned face up next to it to form the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first and the turns proceed clockwise. On their turn, a player must draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. They then have the option to form sets or sequences and lay them down on the table. If a player is unable to lay down any cards, they must discard a card to the discard pile.</p>

<p>Players continue taking turns drawing and discarding cards until one player successfully gets rid of all their cards by forming sets and sequences. This player is declared the winner of the game.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>In Royal Rummy, the face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each, while the number cards are worth their face value. The winner of the game scores zero points, while the other players score points based on the cards left in their hands. The game can be played over multiple rounds, and the player with the lowest total score at the end of the game is declared the overall winner.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Royal Rummy is a fun and engaging card game that requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. With its simple rules and challenging gameplay, it is sure to provide hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels. So gather your friends and family, shuffle up a deck of cards, and get ready to enjoy a royal rummy showdown!</p>
