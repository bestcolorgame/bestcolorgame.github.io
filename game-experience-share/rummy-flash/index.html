<h1>Rummy Flash: A Guide to the Popular Card Game</h1>

<p>Rummy Flash is a fast-paced and exciting card game that has been enjoyed by players of all ages for many years. It is a variation of the classic game of Rummy, with some additional rules and twists that make it even more thrilling. If you're looking to learn more about this popular game, you've come to the right place!</p>

<h2>How to Play Rummy Flash</h2>

<p>In Rummy Flash, the objective is to form sets and runs with the cards you are dealt. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, while a run is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The game is typically played with 2-6 players, and each player is dealt a set number of cards.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each turn, players have the option to draw a card from the deck or the discard pile. They must then discard a card to end their turn. The goal is to create sets and runs with the cards in hand, while also keeping an eye on what other players are discarding to strategize your moves.</p>

<h2>Special Rules in Rummy Flash</h2>

<p>Another important rule to remember is the use of the Joker cards. Jokers can be used as wild cards to substitute for any other card in a set or run. This can be particularly useful when you are close to completing a sequence but are missing a specific card.</p>

<h2>Scoring in Rummy Flash</h2>

<p>Scoring in Rummy Flash is based on the cards left in hand when a player goes out, as well as any unformed sets or runs. Typically, numbered cards are worth their face value, while face cards like Kings, Queens, and Jacks have higher point values.</p>
