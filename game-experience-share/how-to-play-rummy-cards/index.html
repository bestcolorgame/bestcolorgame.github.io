<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to Play Rummy Cards</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is played worldwide. It is a game of skill and strategy that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. If you're interested in learning how to play rummy cards, follow these simple steps below.</p>

<h2>Objective of the Game:</h2>

<p>The objective of rummy is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>How to Play:</h2>

<p>1. <strong>Deck:</strong> Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Jokers are included in the deck and can be used as wild cards.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Dealing:</strong> Each player is dealt a certain number of cards from the deck. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the stockpile.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Gameplay:</strong> The player to the left of the dealer starts the game. On their turn, a player must draw a card from either the stockpile or the discard pile. They must then discard a card to the discard pile. The goal is to form sets and sequences with the cards in hand.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Going Out:</strong> When a player has formed the required sets and sequences, they can declare "Rummy" and lay down their cards on the table. The other players must then show their cards and calculate their points.</p>

<h2>Scoring:</h2>

<p>Scoring in rummy is based on the points assigned to each card. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10 points, and aces are worth 1 point. The objective is to have the lowest number of points at the end of the game.</p>

<h2>Winning the Game:</h2>

<p>The game continues for a pre-determined number of rounds or until a player reaches a certain point threshold. The player with the lowest number of points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>

<h2>Tips for Playing Rummy:</h2>

<p>- Pay attention to the cards your opponents are picking and discarding to gain insight into their strategies.<br>
- Try to form sequences early on in the game as they are harder to rearrange later.<br>
- Be strategic with your discards to avoid helping your opponents form their sets.</p>

<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of how to play rummy cards, gather your friends and family for a fun game night. Remember, practice makes perfect, so the more you play, the better you'll become at this exciting card game!</p>
