    <h1>Rummy vs Gin Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy and Gin Rummy are two popular card games that are often confused with each other due to their similarities. While both games share some common rules and objectives, there are key differences that set them apart. Let's take a closer look at the differences between Rummy and Gin Rummy.</p>

    <h2>Rummy:</h2>

    <p>Rummy is a group of matching-card games that are played based on matching cards of the same rank or sequence and same suit. The basic objective in Rummy is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and sequences (three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order).</p>

    <p>One of the variations of Rummy is Indian Rummy, which is hugely popular in India and is played with two decks of cards and two jokers. The game typically involves two to six players and is played over several rounds until a player reaches the agreed-upon points total.</p>

    <h2>Gin Rummy:</h2>

    <p>Gin Rummy is a variant of Rummy that is played with two players and is more fast-paced than traditional Rummy. The key difference between Gin Rummy and Rummy is that in Gin Rummy, players are required to form their entire hand into sets or runs, with no deadwood left.</p>

    <p>In Gin Rummy, players aim to be the first to reach 100 points by forming sets and runs and then "knocking" to end the round. The opponent must then lay down their unmatched cards, and the total deadwood points are calculated. The player with the lower deadwood count wins the round.</p>

    <h2>Main Differences:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Rummy can be played with multiple players, while Gin Rummy is typically played with two players.</li>
        <li>In Rummy, players aim to form sets and sequences, while Gin Rummy focuses on forming your entire hand into sets or runs.</li>
        <li>Gin Rummy is usually played in a single hand, while Rummy can be played over multiple rounds.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both Rummy and Gin Rummy are fun and challenging card games that require skill, strategy, and a good memory. Whether you prefer the group dynamic of Rummy or the head-to-head competition of Gin Rummy, both games offer hours of entertainment for players of all ages.</p>
