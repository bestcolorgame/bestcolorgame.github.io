    <h1>Rummy Hands</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. The game can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards or with special decks designed for the game. One of the key elements of rummy is forming "hands" or sets of cards that follow specific combinations and rules. In this article, we will explore some common rummy hands that players aim to achieve during the game.</p>

    <h2>Sets</h2>
    <p>One of the primary objectives in rummy is to form sets of cards. A set typically consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. For example, a set could be three 7s or four Queens. Sets are essential for reducing the number of points in your hand and ultimately winning the game.</p>

    <h2>Sequences</h2>
    <p>Another important aspect of rummy is forming sequences or runs of consecutive cards in the same suit. A sequence could be as simple as 3, 4, 5 of Hearts or more complex like 7, 8, 9, 10 of Spades. Sequences are crucial for declaring the game and earning points based on the cards in your opponents' hands.</p>

    <h2>Melding</h2>
    <p>In rummy, players take turns drawing and discarding cards in an attempt to create winning hands. Melding is the process of laying down valid sets and sequences on the table to declare the game. Once a player has formed all required combinations, they can go out by discarding their last card and declaring "Rummy!" to win the round.</p>

    <h2>Common Rummy Hands</h2>
    <p>Here are some common rummy hands that players strive to achieve:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pure Sequence:</strong> A sequence without any Joker cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Impure Sequence:</strong> A sequence that includes Joker cards.</li>
        <li><strong>Set:</strong> Three or four cards of the same rank.</li>
        <li><strong>First Life:</strong> A pure sequence followed by a set or another pure sequence.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Life:</strong> A pure sequence followed by a set or another pure sequence after forming the first life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Rummy hands play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the game. By strategically forming sets and sequences, players can increase their chances of winning and outsmarting their opponents. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, mastering the art of creating winning hands is essential for succeeding in the game of rummy.</p>
