    <h2>History of Rummy</h2>

    <h2>Basics of Rummy</h2>

    <p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank, while a run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>Players take turns drawing cards from the deck or the discard pile and discarding unwanted cards to form valid sets and runs. The game continues until a player "goes out" by getting rid of all their cards or by forming valid sets and runs.</p>
