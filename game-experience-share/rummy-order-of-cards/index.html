    <h1>The Order of Cards in Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. One of the key elements of playing rummy is understanding the order of cards and how they rank in the game. Whether you are playing Indian Rummy, Gin Rummy, or any other variant, knowing the order of cards is essential to form valid sets and sequences. Let's dive into the hierarchy of cards in rummy:</p>

    <h2>1. Ace</h2>
    <p>The Ace card holds the highest value in rummy. It can be used as either a high card (after the King) or a low card (before the 2), making it extremely versatile in forming sequences.</p>

    <h2>4. Joker</h2>
    <p>In some variations of rummy, a Joker card is used. Jokers can be wild cards and substitute for any other card in the game. They are valuable in creating impure sequences.</p>

    <h2>5. Understanding Suits</h2>
    <p>While playing rummy, it's essential to understand the concept of suits. Cards are categorized into four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. When forming sequences or sets, cards within the same suit are usually preferred.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Mastering the order of cards in rummy is fundamental to playing the game successfully. By understanding the hierarchy of cards, including face cards, number cards, and the role of Jokers, players can strategize better and form valid sequences and sets. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep playing and honing your rummy skills!</p>
