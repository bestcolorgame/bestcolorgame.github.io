    <h1>What is Rummy?</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. The game is typically played with 2-6 players and a standard deck of 52 cards.</p>

    <h2>Objective of Rummy</h2>

    <p>The objective of Rummy is to form sets and sequences of cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

    <p>At the start of the game, each player is dealt a certain number of cards from the deck. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile. Players take turns to draw cards from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discard a card from their hand.</p>

    <p>The game continues in this manner until a player forms sets and sequences with all the cards in their hand and declares "Rummy". The other players then have to tally up the points in their hands based on the cards they are holding.</p>

    <h2>Scoring in Rummy</h2>

    <p>In Rummy, each card has a certain point value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each, while numbered cards are worth their face value. Aces are usually worth 1 point.</p>

    <p>If a player declares Rummy, they score zero points for that round. However, if a player does not declare Rummy and still has cards in their hand when another player goes out, they are penalized for the cards they are holding.</p>

    <h2>Variants of Rummy</h2>

    <p>Rummy has many variants, with some of the most popular ones being Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, and Kalooki. Each variant has its own set of rules and gameplay, but the basic principles of forming sets and sequences remain the same.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Playing Rummy</h2>

    <p>Playing Rummy can have several benefits, including improving cognitive skills such as memory, concentration, and strategic thinking. It can also be a fun way to socialize and connect with friends and family.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Rummy is a timeless card game that has been enjoyed by generations of players. Whether you are a seasoned pro or a beginner, the game offers endless opportunities for entertainment and friendly competition. So gather your friends and family, shuffle the cards, and enjoy a game of Rummy!</p>
