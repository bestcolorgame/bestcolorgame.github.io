<h2>Rules of Big Rummy</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Each player is dealt a set number of cards (usually 10 cards for 2-3 players, 7 cards for 4-5 players, and 6 cards for 6 players).</li>
  <li>The remaining deck is placed face-down on the table, with the top card flipped over to start the discard pile.</li>
  <li>Players take turns to either draw a card from the deck or the discard pile and then discard a card.</li>
  <li>Players must try to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more cards in consecutive order of the same suit).</li>
  <li>Aces can be either high or low (A-2-3 or Q-K-A) but cannot be part of a run with both high and low values.</li>
  <li>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the round and scores points based on the remaining cards in other players' hands.</li>
  <li>The game continues for a pre-determined number of rounds, and the player with the highest total score at the end of the game is declared the winner.</li>

<p>To improve your chances of winning at Big Rummy, here are some strategy tips to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on forming sets first before going for runs.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the cards your opponents are picking up and discarding to try and figure out their strategy.</li>
  <li>Avoid holding onto high-value cards for too long, as they can quickly increase your score if you don't get rid of them.</li>
  <li>Try to create multiple options for melding your cards by keeping different combinations in your hand.</li>
