    <h1>How to Play Rummy Game</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. It can be played with 2-6 players, and the objective is to form sets and sequences of cards. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to play rummy:</p>

    <h2>Setting Up</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Shuffle the deck of cards and deal a set number of cards to each player.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining cards in the center, forming the draw pile. Turn the top card face-up to start the discard pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>On your turn, you can either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
        <li>Arrange your cards to form sets (3 or 4 cards of the same rank) and sequences (3 or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order).</li>
        <li>Once you have a valid hand, you can declare and show your cards to the other players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>At the end of each round, players score points based on the cards remaining in their hands.</li>
        <li>Face cards are worth 10 points, numbered cards are worth their face value, and Aces are worth 1 point.</li>
        <li>The game continues for several rounds, and the player with the lowest score at the end wins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Winning</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Focus on forming sequences early in the game as they are worth more points.</li>
        <li>Keep track of the cards your opponents pick from the discard pile to avoid giving them the cards they need.</li>
        <li>Be strategic in your discards to confuse your opponents and prevent them from completing their sets.</li>
    </ul>
