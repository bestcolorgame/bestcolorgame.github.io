<h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a certain number of cards (usually 10 or 13 cards, depending on the variation being played). The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

<p>Players take turns to draw cards from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. The goal is to form valid sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit) in your hand. Once a player has formed valid sets and runs, they can declare their hand and end the game.</p>

  <li><strong>Rummy 500:</strong> This variation is played with a standard deck of cards and involves scoring points for cards that are melded. The game is typically played to a target score of 500 points.</li>
