<h1>The Classic Card Game: Rummy</h1>

The game's objective is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents, leading to a thrilling and competitive game.</p>

<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
<p>The basic rules of Rummy are fairly simple. Each player is dealt a hand of cards from a standard deck and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table, forming the draw pile. Players take turns drawing cards from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discarding a card from their hand. The goal is to form sets of three or four cards of the same rank or sequences of three or more cards in the same suit.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

Face cards are worth 10 points, Aces are worth 1 point, and numbered cards are worth their face value. The player who goes out first in a round earns a zero score, while the remaining players add up the points in their hands. The game usually consists of several rounds, and the player with the lowest total score at the end is declared the winner.</p>

<h2>Variations of Rummy</h2>
<p>There are many variations of Rummy played around the world, with some of the most popular ones being Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, and Canasta. Each variation has its own set of rules and strategies, adding a unique twist to the classic game.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Playing Rummy</h3>
