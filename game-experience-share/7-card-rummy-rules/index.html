    <h1>7 Card Rummy Rules</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. One variation of this game is 7 card rummy, which requires each player to pick and discard cards to form sets and sequences. Here are the rules for playing 7 card rummy:</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of 7 card rummy is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and sequences (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit) using the 7 cards dealt to each player.</p>

    <h2>Dealing</h2>
    <p>Each player is dealt 7 cards at the beginning of the game. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players take turns to either pick a card from the draw pile or the discard pile. After picking a card, they must discard one card to the discard pile. The goal is to form valid sets and sequences with the 7 cards in hand.</p>

    <h2>Valid Sets and Sequences</h2>
    <p>A valid set in 7 card rummy consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. A valid sequence consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. Jokers can be used as wild cards to substitute any other card to form a set or sequence.</p>

    <h2>Winning</h2>
    <p>The first player to form valid sets and sequences with all their cards declares "Rummy" and wins the game. The other players count the points left in their hands based on the cards they were unable to meld.</p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>In 7 card rummy, the point value of each card is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number cards: Face value</li>
        <li>Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points each</li>
        <li>Ace: 1 point</li>
        <li>Joker: 0 points</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Playing 7 card rummy is a fun and challenging card game that requires strategy and skill. By forming sets and sequences with your cards and using jokers wisely, you can outmaneuver your opponents and declare "Rummy" to win the game. So gather your friends and family, shuffle the cards, and enjoy a game of 7 card rummy!</p>
