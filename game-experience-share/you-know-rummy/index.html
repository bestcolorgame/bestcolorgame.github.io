        <li>Players must discard a card at the end of their turn.</li>
        <li>Sets and runs must be valid to be considered melded.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Gin Rummy:</strong> A two-player variation of rummy that is fast-paced and highly strategic. The goal is to form melds of sets and runs while minimizing deadwood points.</li>
        <li><strong>Rummy 500:</strong> This version is played with points. Players aim to reach 500 points by forming valid sets and runs, with cards carrying different point values.</li>
    </ol>
