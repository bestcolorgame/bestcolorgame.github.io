    <h1>The Thrilling World of Rummy Case</h1>

    <p>Rummy Case is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by players for generations. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents do. It is a game that requires quick thinking and sharp observation skills.</p>

    <p>The game is typically played with two decks of cards and two jokers. Each player is dealt a set number of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. The top card from the draw pile is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

    <p>Players take turns to either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card. The objective is to form sequences (consecutive cards of the same suit) and sets (cards of the same rank) to declare the game. The first player to successfully form valid sequences and sets and declare the game wins that round.</p>
