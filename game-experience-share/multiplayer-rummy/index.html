<h1>Multiplayer Rummy: A Fun and Competitive Card Game</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by players for decades. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. One of the most exciting ways to play rummy is in a multiplayer setting, where you can challenge your friends or other players from around the world.</p>

<h2>How to Play Multiplayer Rummy:</h2>

<p>In multiplayer rummy, the basic rules of the game remain the same as in traditional rummy. The objective is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is a group of three or more cards of consecutive ranks in the same suit.</p>

<p>Players take turns drawing and discarding cards until one player declares "Rummy" by forming valid sets and runs in their hand. The other players then have a chance to lay off any of their remaining cards onto the declared player's sets and runs. The game continues until one player has no cards left in their hand, signaling the end of the round.</p>
