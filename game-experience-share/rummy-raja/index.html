<h2>Rules of Rummy Raja:</h2>

<p>1. Each player is dealt 13 cards at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>2. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile.</p>
<p>3. The top card from the draw pile is placed face up to start the discard pile.</p>
<p>4. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discarding a card.</p>
<p>5. The objective is to form runs (sequences of consecutive cards in the same suit) and sets (three or four cards of the same rank).</p>
<p>6. Once a player has formed all of their cards into valid sets and runs, they can declare and end the game.</p>
<p>7. The other players must then total up the value of the cards left in their hands and add them to their score.</p>
<p>8. The player with the lowest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>

<h2>Strategy in Rummy Raja:</h2>

<p>1. Pay attention to what cards your opponents are picking up and discarding to try and figure out what sets and runs they are trying to form.</p>
<p>2. Keep track of the cards that have been discarded to help you decide which cards to pick up and which to discard.</p>
<p>3. Try to form your sets and runs as quickly as possible to avoid getting caught with high-value cards in your hand.</p>
<p>4. Be strategic in your discards to try and throw off your opponents and prevent them from forming their sets and runs.</p>
<p>5. Don't be afraid to rearrange your sets and runs during the game if it will help you form new sets and runs more quickly.</p>

<p>Rummy Raja is a game that requires both skill and strategy to win. It is a fun and exciting game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. So gather your friends and family and try your hand at Rummy Raja today!</p>
