    <h2>How to Play:</h2>

    <p>Rummy Lite is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards by forming sets and runs. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is a group of three or more cards in sequential order of the same suit. Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center to form the draw pile.</p>

    <p>Players take turns drawing a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discarding a card from their hand. The game continues until one player successfully empties their hand by forming sets and runs. That player is declared the winner of the round, and the other players tally up the points in their remaining hands. The goal is to be the first player to reach a set number of points, typically 100 or 500 points, depending on the agreed-upon rules.</p>
