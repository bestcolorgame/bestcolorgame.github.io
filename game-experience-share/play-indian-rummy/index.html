    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Play Indian Rummy</h1>

    <p>Indian Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. It is a fun and exciting game that requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. The game is played with two decks of cards and can be enjoyed with 2 to 6 players. The objective of the game is to form sequences and sets of cards and be the first player to declare your hand.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Indian Rummy:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt 13 cards.</li>
        <li>A random card is selected from the deck and placed face up to start the discard pile.</li>
        <li>On their turn, a player must draw a card from the deck or the discard pile.</li>
        <li>The player must then discard a card to the discard pile.</li>
        <li>The goal is to form valid sequences and sets with your cards. A sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, and a set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits.</li>
        <li>Once a player has formed valid sequences and sets, they can declare their hand and end the game.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Strategies for Winning Indian Rummy:</h2>

        <li>Discard high-value cards early in the game to reduce your points in case your opponent declares their hand.</li>

        <li>Be alert and observant to make the best moves based on the cards available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Playing Indian Rummy:</h2>
