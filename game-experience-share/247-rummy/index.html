    <h1>247 Rummy: A Fun Online Card Game</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been played for centuries. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. One of the variations of Rummy is 247 Rummy, a fast-paced online version of the game that can be played anytime, anywhere.</p>

    <h2>How to Play 247 Rummy</h2>

    <p>In 247 Rummy, the objective is to form sets and runs with the cards you are dealt. A set is a group of cards of the same rank, and a run is a sequence of cards in the same suit. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.</p>

    <p>Each player is dealt a hand of 13 cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

    <p>On your turn, you can either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile. You then have to discard a card from your hand to the discard pile. The game continues in this manner until a player forms valid sets and runs with all their cards and declares "Rummy."</p>
