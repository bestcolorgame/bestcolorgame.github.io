    <h1>The Basics of Rummy Scoring</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. One key aspect of playing rummy is keeping track of scores. Understanding rummy scoring is essential to determine the winner at the end of each round. Let's dive into the basics of rummy scoring:</p>

    <h2>Points Allocation</h2>

    <p>In rummy, each card carries a certain point value. The numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each, and the Ace carries either 1 point or 11 points, depending on the player's choice.</p>

    <h2>Scoring in Rummy</h2>

    <p>The basic objective in rummy is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards in your hand. Once a player goes out by melding all their cards into valid combinations, the round ends, and scoring begins. Here's how the scoring works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unmatched cards:</strong> Any cards that are not part of a valid set or sequence are counted individually and added to the player's score.</li>
        <li><strong>Penalty points:</strong> If a player does not finish the game within the stipulated time, penalty points are added to their score.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning hand:</strong> The player who goes out first gets zero points, while the other players' scores are based on the unmatched cards in their hands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Calculating Scores</h2>

    <p>To calculate the scores in rummy, simply add up the point values of the unmatched cards in each player's hand. The player who goes out first with no unmatched cards scores zero points for the round. The other players' scores are determined by their remaining unmatched cards.</p>

    <h2>Strategies for Lower Scores</h2>

    <p>To achieve lower scores in rummy, players should focus on creating valid sets and sequences as quickly as possible. By minimizing the number of unmatched cards in their hands, players can keep their scores low and increase their chances of winning the game.</p>

    <h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

    <p>Scoring in rummy may seem daunting at first, but with practice and experience, players can become adept at tracking scores efficiently. By understanding the point values of cards and focusing on creating valid combinations, players can enhance their rummy skills and enjoy the game even more.</p>
