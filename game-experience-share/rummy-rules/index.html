<h1>Welcome to Rummy Rules!</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. Whether you are a seasoned player or a beginner looking to learn the game, it's important to understand the rules to play and enjoy the game to its fullest.</p>

<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>

<p>The objective of Rummy is to form sets or runs using the cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run is a sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>Deck of Cards</h2>

<p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Jokers are often used as wild cards that can be used as substitutes for any other card in the deck.</p>

<h2>Dealing the Cards</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a certain number of cards from the deck. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile, while the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>On their turn, players have the option to either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discard a card of their choice. The game continues in this manner as players try to form sets and runs in their hand.</p>

<h2>Ending the Game</h2>

<p>The game ends when a player successfully forms sets or runs with all the cards in their hand and discards their final card onto the discard pile. The other players then tally up the points in their hands based on the cards they still hold.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>At the end of the game, the total points in each player's hand are tallied up. Face cards are worth 10 points, aces are worth 1 point, and numbered cards are worth their face value. The player with the lowest total score wins the game.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p>There are many variations of Rummy, including Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, and Canasta, each with its own set of rules and gameplay. It's important to familiarize yourself with the specific rules of the variation you are playing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rummy is a fun and challenging card game that requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck to win. Whether you are playing with friends or family, understanding the rules of the game is key to enjoying a rousing game of Rummy.</p>
