  <li><strong>Use the jokers wisely:</strong> Jokers can be used as wild cards to substitute for any other card in a set or run, so use them strategically to complete your combinations.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan your moves ahead:</strong> Think ahead and plan your moves carefully to avoid getting stuck with unusable cards in your hand.</li>
