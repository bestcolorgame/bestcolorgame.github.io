    <h1>The Order in Rummy: A Complete Guide</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is played worldwide. One of the key aspects of playing rummy is understanding the order in which the cards are arranged. This is crucial to forming valid sets and sequences to win the game. Here is a complete guide to the order in rummy:</p>

    <h2>Sequence of Cards</h2>
    
    <p>In rummy, the cards are ordered in a specific sequence. The order of the cards is as follows:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Ace (A)</li>
        <li> 2</li>
        <li> 3</li>
        <li> 4</li>
        <li> 5</li>
        <li> 6</li>
        <li> 7</li>
        <li> 8</li>
        <li> 9</li>
        <li> 10</li>
        <li> Jack (J)</li>
        <li> Queen (Q)</li>
        <li> King (K)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Suits in Rummy</h2>

    <p>Just like in a standard deck of cards, the cards in rummy are divided into four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each suit has 13 cards, making a total of 52 cards in a standard deck. In rummy, cards of the same suit can be used to form a sequence or a set.</p>

    <h2>Forming Sets and Sequences</h2>

    <p>In rummy, players aim to form valid sets and sequences. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. For example, a set could be three 7s from different suits. A sequence, on the other hand, is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, a sequence could be 4, 5, and 6 of Hearts.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>

    <p>To win a game of rummy, a player must form at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence (a sequence without a Joker). Additionally, the player must form valid sets to have a winning hand. Once a player forms the required sets and sequences, they can declare and win the game.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Understanding the order of cards in rummy is essential to playing the game successfully. By forming valid sets and sequences in the correct order, players can increase their chances of winning. So, make sure to familiarize yourself with the sequence of cards and practice your skills to become a pro at rummy!</p>
