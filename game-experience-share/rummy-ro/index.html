<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>

<p>The objective of rummy is to form sets and sequences of cards in your hand and lay them down on the table before your opponents. A set is three or four cards of the same rank, and a sequence is three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The player who successfully melds all their cards first wins the game.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a set number of cards from a standard 52-card deck. The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face-up next to it to start the discard pile. On their turn, players can either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. The game continues in this manner until one player declares rummy.</p>
