A valid set consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a valid sequence comprises of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>
<p>Players take turns to draw a card from the closed or open deck and discard one card to reduce their hand to the required 13 cards. The player who successfully melds all their cards into valid sets and sequences first wins the game.</p>
