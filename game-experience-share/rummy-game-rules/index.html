<h1>Rummy Game Rules</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether you are playing with family or friends, it is important to understand the rules of the game to have an enjoyable experience. Here are the basic rules of playing Rummy:</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of Rummy is to form sets or runs of cards before your opponents. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run is a sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>Dealing the Cards</h2>
<p>Each player is dealt a certain number of cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (usually 10 cards for 2 players, 7 cards for 3-4 players). The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up next to it, forming the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Players take turns to either pick up a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. The goal is to form valid sets or runs and reduce the number of unmatched cards in your hand. A player can also lay down valid sets or runs during their turn.</p>

<h2>Winning the Game</h2>
<p>The game continues until a player forms valid sets or runs with all their cards and declares "Rummy". The other players must then lay down their cards, with any unmatched cards counting as points against them. The player with the lowest total points wins the game.</p>

<h2>Penalties</h2>
<p>If a player fails to lay down their cards before another player declares Rummy, they may face a penalty of additional points for the unmatched cards in their hand. It is important to pay attention and strategize to avoid penalties in Rummy.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>To play Rummy successfully, it is important to focus on forming sets or runs early in the game. Keep track of which cards are being discarded by your opponents to gauge which ones you should pick up. Remember to pay attention to the cards you are discarding to avoid helping your opponents form their sets.</p>
