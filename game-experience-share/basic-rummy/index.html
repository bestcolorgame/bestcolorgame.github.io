<h1>Basic Rummy: A Fun and Easy Card Game to Play</h1>

<h2>How to Play Basic Rummy</h2>

<p>To play Basic Rummy, you will need a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set is three or four cards of the same rank (e.g., 3 of Hearts, 3 of Diamonds, 3 of Spades), while a run is three or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4, 5, 6 of Clubs).</p>

<p>Here is a simple step-by-step guide to playing Basic Rummy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each player is dealt 10 cards.</li>
  <li>The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile.</li>
  <li>On your turn, you can either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
  <li>After drawing a card, you must discard one card from your hand.</li>
  <li>The game continues in this manner until a player forms sets and runs with all their cards and goes out.</li>
  <li>The other players then add up the points in their hands (number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10 points, and Aces are worth 1 point) and the player who went out receives zero points.</li>
  <li>The game is usually played over several rounds, and the player with the lowest score at the end is the winner.</li>
</ol>
