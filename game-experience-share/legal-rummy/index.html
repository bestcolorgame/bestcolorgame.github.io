<h1>Legal Rummy: Understanding the Rules and Regulations</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. However, in some regions, the legality of playing rummy for real money can be a complicated issue. It is important to understand the rules and regulations surrounding rummy to ensure that you are playing within the law.</p>

<h2>Is Rummy Legal?</h2>

<p>In many countries, rummy is considered a game of skill rather than a game of chance, which means that it is not classified as gambling. This distinction is important because gambling laws vary from one jurisdiction to another. In India, for example, the Supreme Court has ruled that playing rummy for stakes is legal as long as it is a game of skill and not just a game of chance.</p>

<h2>Rules of Rummy</h2>

<p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>The game begins with each player being dealt a hand of cards. Players take turns drawing and discarding cards until one player is able to form valid sets and sequences with their cards. The game ends when a player "declares" by showing their sets and sequences to the other players.</p>

<h2>Online Rummy</h2>

<p>With the rise of online gaming, rummy has also become a popular game to play online. Many websites and apps offer the opportunity to play rummy for real money. It is important to check the legality of online rummy in your region before participating in such games.</p>
