Here is a comprehensive guide to help you understand the rules, strategies, and tips to improve your Rummy game.</p>

    <h2>Rules of Rummy:</h2>

    <p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table as the draw pile. The following are the basic rules of Rummy:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Form sets: A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits.</li>
        <li>Form sequences: A sequence consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</li>
        <li>Draw and discard: On your turn, you must draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card to maintain a hand of the required number of cards.</li>
        <li>Winning: The game ends when a player forms all their cards into sets or sequences. The player who goes out first wins the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategies for Rummy:</h2>

    <p>To improve your chances of winning at Rummy, consider the following strategies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Focus on forming sequences early in the game as they carry zero points.</li>
        <li>Keep track of the cards your opponents pick and discard to guess their possible sequences.</li>
        <li>Discard high-value cards early in the game to minimize your points in case your opponent wins.</li>
        <li>Hold onto high-ranking cards that may form a sequence later in the game.</li>
        <li>Stay alert and observant of your opponents' gameplay to adapt your strategy accordingly.</li>
