<p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by millions of players worldwide for decades. One of the key aspects of the game is forming valid sets and sequences with the cards you are dealt. In this article, we will explore different types of rummy hands and provide a comprehensive guide to help you improve your game.</p>

<h2>1. Pure Sequence</h2>
<p>A pure sequence is a group of consecutive cards of the same suit. In rummy, it is essential to have at least one pure sequence to declare a valid hand. For example, 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ is a pure sequence.</p>

<h2>2. Impure Sequence</h2>
<p>An impure sequence is a group of consecutive cards with at least one card from a different suit. For example, 8♦ 9♦ 10♥ is an impure sequence.</p>

<h2>3. Set</h2>
<p>A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. For example, 3♠ 3♥ 3♦ is a set.</p>

<h2>4. Full House</h2>
<p>A full house consists of a set and a pair. For example, 7♣ 7♠ 7♦ 5♠ 5♦ is a full house.</p>

<h2>5. Joker Usage</h2>
<p>In some variations of rummy, jokers are used as wild cards that can substitute for any other card to form a valid sequence or set.</p>

<h2>6. High Card Hand</h2>
<p>If you are unable to form any valid sequences or sets with the cards you are dealt, your hand is considered a high card hand. In this case, it is recommended to discard high-value cards to minimize your points in case of a loss.</p>

<h2>7. Winning Hand</h2>
<p>To win a game of rummy, you need to form valid sets and sequences with your cards and have at least one pure sequence in your hand before declaring. Once you declare, your opponents will have a chance to validate your hand before the game concludes.</p>

<h2>8. Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
<p>Improving your rummy skills requires practice and strategic thinking. By familiarizing yourself with different types of rummy hands and studying how to form valid sets and sequences, you can enhance your gameplay and increase your chances of winning.</p>

<p>Remember, rummy is not just about luck but also about skill and strategy. So next time you play a game of rummy, keep this guide in mind and aim to create the best possible hand to outsmart your opponents.</p>
