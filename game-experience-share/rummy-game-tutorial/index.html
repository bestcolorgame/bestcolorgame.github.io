<h1>Rummy Game Tutorial</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is easy to learn but challenging to master. It is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and can be enjoyed by 2 to 6 players. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents do. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play rummy:</p>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<p>Shuffle the deck of cards and deal a set number of cards to each player (usually 10 cards for 2 players, 7 cards for 3-4 players, and 6 cards for 5-6 players). The remaining cards form the draw pile, with the top card placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>On their turn, a player must either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile. The player can then choose to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank but different suits) and sequences (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit) and lay them down on the table. A player must have at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence (without a joker), to declare a rummy.</p>

<p>Players can also lay off cards onto sequences or sets that have been laid down by other players. A joker can be used as a substitute for any missing card in a sequence or set.</p>

<h2>Declaring a Rummy</h2>

<p>When a player has formed all their cards into valid sets and sequences, they can declare a rummy. To do so, the player must place their final card face down on the discard pile and announce that they have completed their hand. The other players must then reveal their cards and calculate the points left in their hands.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>In rummy, the number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, while face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points each. Aces can be worth either 1 point or 10 points, depending on how the player chooses to use them in sets and sequences. To win a round, a player must have 0 points in their hand when they declare a rummy.</p>

<h2>Winning the Game</h2>

<p>At the end of a pre-determined number of rounds, the player with the lowest cumulative score wins the game. Points are tallied after each round, and the player who wins a round earns zero points. The game continues until a player reaches the agreed-upon score limit.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<p>- Pay attention to the cards your opponents pick and discard to deduce their strategy.<br>
- Try to form a pure sequence early in the game to avoid getting penalized with high points.<br>
- Use jokers strategically to complete sets and sequences.<br>
- Plan your moves ahead and think about the possible combinations of cards you could create.</p>

<p>Now that you know the basics of playing rummy, gather your friends or family for a fun and challenging card game night!</p>
