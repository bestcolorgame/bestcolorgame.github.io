    <h1>The Benefits of Yoga for Mental Health</h1>

    <p>Yoga has been practiced for centuries for its physical and mental health benefits. In recent years, there has been a growing body of research supporting the positive effects of yoga on mental well-being. Here are some of the key mental health benefits of incorporating yoga into your routine:</p>

    <h2>Stress Reduction</h2>

    <p>One of the primary benefits of yoga is its ability to reduce stress. Through a combination of physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, yoga can help calm the mind and body, lowering stress levels and promoting relaxation. Regular practice of yoga has been shown to lower cortisol levels, the hormone associated with stress, helping individuals better cope with daily challenges.</p>

The focus on mindfulness and self-awareness in yoga practice can help individuals become more in tune with their emotions and feelings. This heightened sense of self-awareness can lead to a greater sense of overall happiness and contentment.</p>
