    <h1>Number of Cards in a Game of Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill and strategy that can be played with 2 to 6 players. The number of cards used in a game of rummy can vary depending on the specific variation being played.</p>

    <h2>Standard Rummy</h2>

    <p>In the standard version of rummy, also known as "Indian Rummy" or "Paplu," each player is dealt 13 cards. The goal of the game is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards in hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. The player who successfully melds all their cards wins the game.</p>

    <h2>Gin Rummy</h2>

    <p>Gin Rummy is another popular variation of the game in which each player is dealt 10 cards. The objective is to form sets and sequences just like in standard rummy, but the game has its own unique rules and scoring system. Gin Rummy is typically played as a two-player game and requires a keen sense of strategy and card management.</p>
