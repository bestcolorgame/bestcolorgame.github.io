<h1>The Exciting Game of Rummy</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a bit of luck that can be played with two to six players.

<h2>Rules of Rummy:</h2>

<p>1. The dealer shuffles the deck and deals a set number of cards to each player.</p>
<p>2. The remaining cards form the draw pile and the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>
<p>3. Players take turns to draw a card from the draw or discard pile and then discard a card. The goal is to form sets or runs of cards in their hand.</p>
<p>4. A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. A run consists of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>
<p>5. The game continues until a player declares they have formed all their cards into valid sets or runs. The other players then have one final turn to improve their hand before scoring.</p>

<h2>Scoring in Rummy:</h2>

<p>At the end of each round, players score points based on the cards left in their hand. Face cards are worth 10 points, numbered cards are worth their face value, and Aces are worth 1 point. The winner of the round scores zero points.</p>
