    <h2>1. Stress Reduction</h2>

    <p>Gardening allows individuals to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life and focus on the present moment. The act of tending to plants, flowers, or vegetables can be incredibly calming and meditative, helping to reduce stress levels and promote relaxation.</p>

    <h2>2. Physical Exercise</h2>

    <p>Engaging in gardening activities, such as digging, planting, and weeding, can provide a great workout for both the body and mind. The physical exertion involved in gardening releases endorphins, the body's natural mood enhancers, which can help alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
