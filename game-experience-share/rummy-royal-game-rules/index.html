<h1>Rummy Royal Game Rules</h1>

<p>Rummy Royal is a popular card game that is enjoyed by players of all ages. The game is played with two decks of standard playing cards and can be played by 2 to 6 players. The objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards and be the first player to lay down all their cards.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Each player is dealt a hand of 13 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up to start the discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>On their turn, a player must draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. The player then has the option to lay down sets or runs of cards from their hand onto the table. A set consists of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run consists of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>Once a player has laid down their initial set or run, they can then add on to their own sets or runs or to those of their opponents. Players can also rearrange the cards on the table to form new sets or runs.</p>

<p>The game continues in this manner until a player has laid down all their cards. This player is declared the winner of the round, and the other players' remaining cards are totaled up as penalty points.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>In Rummy Royal, the objective is to minimize the number of penalty points you accrue. The value of the cards are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number cards are worth their face value</li>
  <li>Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points each</li>
  <li>Aces are worth 1 point each</li>
</ul>

<p>The winner of the round scores 0 points, while the other players add up the value of the cards remaining in their hand. The game can be played over multiple rounds, and the player with the lowest total score at the end is declared the overall winner.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rummy Royal is a fun and challenging card game that requires strategic thinking and careful planning. By forming sets and runs of cards and minimizing penalty points, players can outwit their opponents and emerge victorious. Gather your friends and family to enjoy a game of Rummy Royal and see who will be crowned the ultimate rummy champion!</p>
