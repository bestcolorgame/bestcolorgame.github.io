    <h1>The Order of Rummy Cards</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form valid sets and sequences of cards. Understanding the order of cards is crucial to mastering the game.</p>

    <h2>Card Order in Rummy</h2>

    <p>In Rummy, the cards are ranked from low to high as follows:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Ace (A):</strong> The Ace can be used as a high card (next to King) or as a low card (before 2).</li>
        <li><strong>2 to 10:</strong> Number cards are ranked based on their face value.</li>
        <li><strong>Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K):</strong> These face cards are ranked in that order, with the King being the highest.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Suit Order in Rummy</h2>

    <p>Each card in a deck of playing cards belongs to one of four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades. In Rummy, the suits have no inherent value and are used solely for the purpose of forming sequences.</p>

    <h2>Forming Sets and Sequences</h2>

    <p>In Rummy, players aim to form valid sets and sequences using the cards they are dealt. A set consists of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is made up of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>For example, a valid set could be three Kings of different suits (King of Hearts, King of Diamonds, King of Clubs), while a sequence could be 5-6-7 of Hearts.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>

    <p>Once a player has formed all their cards into valid sets and sequences, they can declare "Rummy" and end the game. The player with the lowest total points based on the remaining cards in their hand wins the game.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Understanding the order of rummy cards and how to form sets and sequences is essential to playing and winning at the game of Rummy. Practice and strategy play a significant role in mastering this classic card game.</p>
