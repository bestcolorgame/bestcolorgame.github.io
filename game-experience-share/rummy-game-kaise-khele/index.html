<h1>How to Play Rummy Game</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is easy to learn and fun to play with friends and family. If you want to know how to play rummy, follow these simple steps:</p>

<h2>Objective of the Game:</h2>
<p>The objective of rummy is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards you have been dealt. A valid set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, while a valid sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Game:</h2>
<p>Rummy is typically played with 2-6 players and a standard deck of 52 cards. Each player is dealt a set number of cards, usually 10 for 2 players, 7 for 3 or 4 players, and 6 for 5 or 6 players. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form a draw pile, and the top card is placed face up next to it to form a discard pile.</p>

<h2>Gameplay:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Draw and Discard:</strong> On your turn, you must draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile. You must then discard a card from your hand onto the discard pile.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Forming Sets and Sequences:</strong> Your goal is to form valid sets and sequences using the cards in your hand. You can also add to sets and sequences already on the table.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Ending the Game:</strong> The game ends when a player forms valid sets and sequences with all the cards in their hand and declares "Rummy". The other players must then reveal their cards and add up the points of the cards left in their hands.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scoring:</h2>
<p>In rummy, each card has a point value. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10 points, and Aces are worth 1 point. The objective is to have the lowest number of points at the end of the game.</p>

<h2>Tips for Playing Rummy:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pay attention to the cards your opponents pick and discard to try and figure out their strategy.</li>
  <li>Focus on forming sequences early in the game, as they are harder to change once you have committed to a set.</li>
  <li>Be mindful of the cards you are discarding, as you do not want to help your opponents complete their sets and sequences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you know how to play rummy, gather your friends and family for a fun and exciting card game. Remember, practice makes perfect, so the more you play, the better you will become at strategizing and forming winning combinations!</p>
