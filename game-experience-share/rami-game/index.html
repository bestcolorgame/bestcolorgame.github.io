<h2>How to Play Rami Game:</h2>

<p>Each player is dealt a certain number of cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (jokers may be included as wild cards). The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile, while the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

<p>Players take turns to draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card. The goal is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards in hand. A set is made up of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is made up of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<h2>Scoring in Rami Game:</h2>

<p>At the end of each round, the players reveal their cards and calculate their scores. Cards are assigned point values as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number cards are worth their face value</li>
  <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each</li>
  <li>Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on its use in a sequence</li>
</ul>

<p>Players then deduct the value of the cards remaining in their hands from their total score. The first player to reach a predetermined score (usually 500 points) wins the game.</p>
