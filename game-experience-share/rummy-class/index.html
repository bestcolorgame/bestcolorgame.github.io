    <h1>The Exciting Game of Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a classic card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck. The game is typically played with two to six players and a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of rummy is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand and lay them down on the table. The player who gets rid of all their cards first wins the game.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt a certain number of cards (usually 10 cards for two players, 7 cards for three or four players, and 6 cards for five or six players).</li>
        <li>The remaining deck is placed face down on the table, and the top card is flipped over to start the discard pile.</li>
        <li>On their turn, players can either draw a card from the deck or the discard pile. The goal is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit).</li>
        <li>Once a player has formed a valid set or run, they can lay it down on the table. The game continues until a player gets rid of all their cards.</li>
        <li>The game can also end if the deck runs out of cards, and no player can make a move.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Strategies for Winning Rummy</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to improve your chances of winning at rummy:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Focus on forming sets first as they are easier to complete than runs.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to the cards your opponents are picking and discarding to figure out their strategy.</li>
        <li>Try to keep your hand as organized as possible to see all your available options clearly.</li>
        <li>Don't hold on to high-value cards for too long as they can increase your penalty points if your opponent wins the round.</li>
        <li>Be flexible with your strategy and adapt to the changing game dynamics.</li>
    </ul>
