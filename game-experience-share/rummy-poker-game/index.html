    <h1>Rummy Poker Game: A Fun Card Game to Play with Friends and Family</h1>

    <p>Rummy Poker is a popular card game that combines the elements of Rummy and Poker. It's a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The game is typically played with 2 to 6 players, and the objective is to create sets and runs of cards to score points and win the game.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy Poker:</h2>

    <p>To play Rummy Poker, you will need a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Jokers are not used in this game. Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the remaining cards are placed in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up to start the discard pile.</p>

    <p>The game consists of several rounds, and in each round, players take turns drawing and discarding cards to form sets and runs. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is a sequence of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>Players can draw cards from the draw pile or the discard pile to complete their sets and runs. The round ends when a player forms a valid hand, with all cards being part of sets or runs. The other players then tally up the points in their hands based on the value of the cards and the player who won the round scores zero points.</p>

    <h2>Scoring in Rummy Poker:</h2>

    <p>In Rummy Poker, each card has a specific point value:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Number cards are worth their face value</li>
        <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each</li>
        <li>Aces are worth 15 points each</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The objective of the game is to score the fewest points possible. The game continues for a set number of rounds, and the player with the lowest total score at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Playing Rummy Poker:</h2>
