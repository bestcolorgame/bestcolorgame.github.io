    <h1>21 Card Rummy Game Rules</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the exciting world of 21 Card Rummy! This card game is a popular variation of the traditional Rummy game, offering more challenge and fun. Here are the rules to help you get started:</p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of 21 Card Rummy is to form valid sets and sequences using 21 cards dealt to each player. A player needs to arrange their cards into at least two sequences, where one should be a pure sequence and the rest can be sets/sequences.</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>21 Card Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards along with two jokers. Each player is dealt 21 cards, and the remaining cards are placed face-down as a closed deck. The top card is placed face-up next to the deck to form the open deck.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players take turns to draw a card from either the closed or open deck and discard one to the open deck. The game continues in a clockwise direction until a player forms the required sets and sequences and declares their cards.</p>

    <h2>Valid Sets and Sequences</h2>
    <p>In 21 Card Rummy, a pure sequence consists of at least three consecutive cards of the same suit without a joker. An impure sequence can have a joker in place of any card. Sets can be formed with cards of the same rank but different suits, including jokers.</p>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>After a player declares their cards, the remaining players need to count the points of their unmatched cards. Face cards (J, Q, K) carry 10 points, Aces carry 10 points, numbered cards carry their face value, and jokers carry zero points.</p>

    <h2>Winning</h2>
    <p>The player who successfully forms the required sets and sequences and declares their cards with zero unmatched points wins the game. The winning player accumulates points based on the opponents' unmatched cards.</p>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>Some strategies for playing 21 Card Rummy include focusing on forming a pure sequence early in the game, using jokers wisely to complete sets and sequences, and observing opponents' discards to understand their game plan.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>21 Card Rummy is an engaging card game that requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. By understanding the rules and practicing consistently, you can become a successful player in this thrilling game. Gather your friends and family to enjoy a fun-filled game night with 21 Card Rummy!</p>
