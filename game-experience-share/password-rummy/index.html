<h1>Welcome to Password Rummy!</h1>

<p>Password Rummy is a fun and engaging card game that combines elements of traditional Rummy with a unique twist. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to build sets and runs of cards while trying to guess your opponents' secret password.</p>

<h2>How to Play:</h2>

<p>Players are dealt a hand of cards and a secret password is chosen by each player. The password is a combination of three cards that are kept hidden from the other players. The rest of the cards are used to form sets and runs as in traditional Rummy.</p>

<p>On their turn, a player can draw a card from the deck or the discard pile and then discard a card to end their turn. The goal is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand while also keeping an eye on your opponents' moves to guess their password.</p>
