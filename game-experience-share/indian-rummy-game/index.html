    <h2>How to Play Indian Rummy:</h2>

    <p>In Indian Rummy, the game is played with two decks of cards and two jokers. Each player is dealt 13 cards, and the objective is to form valid sets and sequences. A valid set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, while a valid sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>The game starts with the dealer dealing cards to each player, and the remaining cards are placed facedown on the table to form the draw and discard piles. Players take turns to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discard one card to the discard pile. The game continues until a player forms valid sets and sequences and declares their hand.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game:</h2>

    <p>Once a player declares their hand, all other players have to reveal their cards. The player who declares their hand with valid sets and sequences wins the game. The winning player receives points based on the cards left in the hands of other players. The game continues for several rounds, and the player with the least points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>
