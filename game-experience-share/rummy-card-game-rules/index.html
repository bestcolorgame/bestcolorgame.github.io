    <h1>Rummy Card Game Rules</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form sets and runs of cards. Here are the basic rules of the game:</p>

    <h2>Setup:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Each player is dealt a certain number of cards (usually 10 cards for a 2-player game, 7 cards for a 3-4 player game).</li>
        <li>The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile.</li>
        <li>The top card from the draw pile is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>On their turn, a player can either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
        <li>The player then has to discard a card to the discard pile.</li>
        <li>The objective is to form sets (three or four cards of the same rank) and runs (three or more consecutive cards of the same suit).</li>
        <li>Aces can be used as high (after the King) or low (before the 2) in runs.</li>
        <li>Once a player has formed valid sets and runs, they can declare and end the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>At the end of each round, the players score points based on the cards remaining in their hands.</li>
        <li>Number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10 points, and Aces are worth 1 point.</li>
        <li>The game continues for a pre-determined number of rounds, and the player with the lowest total score at the end is the winner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variations:</h2>

    <p>There are many variations of Rummy, such as Indian Rummy, Gin Rummy, and Kalooki. Each variation has its own set of rules and gameplay elements, but the basic concept of forming sets and runs remains the same.</p>
