    <h2>Rules of the Game:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt 11 cards at the beginning of the game.</li>
        <li>The remaining cards are placed face down to form the draw pile.</li>
        <li>Players take turns to either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
        <li>The objective is to form sets or sequences of cards in your hand.</li>
        <li>A set is formed by having three or four cards of the same rank but different suits.</li>
        <li>A sequence is formed by having three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</li>
        <li>Once a player has formed a valid set or sequence, they can place it on the table.</li>
        <li>The game continues until a player has formed sets or sequences with all their cards.</li>
        <li>The remaining players count the points in their hands, with face cards worth 10 points and numbered cards worth their face value.</li>
        <li>The player with the lowest total points wins the game.</li>
