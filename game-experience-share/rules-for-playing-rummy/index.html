    <h1>Rules for Playing Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. The game is easy to learn but can be challenging to master. If you're new to rummy or need a refresher on the rules, here's a handy guide to get you started.</p>

    <h2>Objective of the Game:</h2>
    <p>The main objective of rummy is to form sets or runs of cards in your hand. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits, while a run is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <h2>Setup:</h2>
    <p>Rummy is typically played with a standard 52-card deck. Depending on the number of players, a certain number of decks may be used. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile. The top card is placed face up next to the draw pile to start the discard pile.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>During their turn, a player must either draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card. The goal is to form valid sets or runs and to be the first player to go out by getting rid of all their cards.</p>

    <h2>Valid Sets and Runs:</h2>
    <p>A valid set must consist of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits. A valid run must consist of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. Jokers can be used as wild cards to substitute for any other card in a set or run.</p>

    <h2>Scoring:</h2>
    <p>At the end of each round, players score points based on the cards remaining in their hands. Face cards are worth 10 points, aces are worth 1 point, and numbered cards are worth their face value. The objective is to have the lowest score at the end of the game.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game:</h2>
    <p>The game continues until a player reaches the agreed-upon point total or until a player goes out by getting rid of all their cards. The player with the lowest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Playing Rummy:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to form sets or runs early in the game.</li>
        <li>Keep track of the cards that your opponents pick up and discard.</li>
        <li>Use jokers strategically to complete sets or runs.</li>
        <li>Discard high-value cards that you cannot use in sets or runs.</li>
    </ul>
