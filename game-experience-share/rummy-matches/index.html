            <h2>The Basics of Rummy Matches</h2>
            <p>Rummy is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the goal is to form sets or runs of cards. A set
                consists of three or four cards of the same rank, while a run consists of three or more cards in sequence and of
                the same suit. The player who gets rid of all their cards first wins the game.</p>
