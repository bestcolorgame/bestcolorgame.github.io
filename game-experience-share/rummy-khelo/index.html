<h2>How to Play Rummy</h2>

<p>Rummy is typically played with 2-6 players and a standard deck of 52 cards. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards and the objective is to form sets and sequences with the cards in hand. A set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, while a sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>The game begins with each player being dealt a set number of cards and the remaining cards placed face-down on the table as the draw pile. Players take turns to draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile, and then discard a card from their hand. The game continues until a player forms all their cards in sets and sequences, at which point they declare "Rummy" and win the game.</p>
