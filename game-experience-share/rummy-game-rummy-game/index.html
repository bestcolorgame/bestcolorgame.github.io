<h1>Rummy Game: A Fun and Challenging Card Game</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. It is a game of skill, strategy, and luck that can be played with 2-6 players. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand.</p>

<h2>How to Play Rummy:</h2>

<p>To start the game, each player is dealt a set number of cards (usually 10 cards for 2 players, 7 cards for 3-4 players, and 6 cards for 5-6 players). The remaining deck is placed face down on the table, with one card turned face up next to it to start the discard pile.</p>

<p>On their turn, players have the option to draw the top card from the deck or the top card from the discard pile. The player then has to either discard a card from their hand or lay down sets and runs of cards. A set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank (e.g. 8-8-8) and a run is a sequence of 3 or more consecutive cards in the same suit (e.g. 4-5-6 of hearts).</p>

<p>The game continues with players taking turns to draw and discard cards until a player is able to form their entire hand into sets and runs, at which point they can declare "Rummy" and win the round.
