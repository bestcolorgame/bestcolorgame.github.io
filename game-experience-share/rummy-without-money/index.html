<h1>Rummy Without Money</h1>

<p>Playing rummy without money can be a fun and enjoyable way to pass the time with friends and family. While the game is traditionally played for stakes, removing money from the equation can make the game more relaxed and stress-free.</p>

<h2>Rules of Rummy</h2>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to form sets and runs of cards in your hand. A set is three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a certain number of cards, and the remaining cards are placed in the center of the table, forming the draw pile. Players take turns drawing cards from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discarding a card from their hand. The first player to form valid sets and runs and declare their hand is the winner of the game.</p>
