    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>

    <p>
        Blackbucks are best known for the striking contrast between the males and females. Males have a dark brown to black coat with white markings on the face, belly, and around the eyes, while females have a lighter fawn color with no horns. The males also have long twisted horns that can reach up to 70-80 cm in length. These distinct features make the blackbuck a visually stunning animal to observe in the wild.
    </p>

    <h2>Habitat and Behavior</h2>

    <p>
        Blackbucks prefer open grasslands and plains where they can roam freely and graze on grass and shrubs. They are often found in herds, with males establishing territories and engaging in impressive fights to assert dominance. These fights involve locking horns and pushing each other in a display of strength and power. Blackbucks are also known for their incredible speed and agility, which they use to evade predators such as wolves and cheetahs.

    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>

    <p>
        While blackbucks were once abundant throughout India, their population has declined due to habitat loss and hunting. They are currently listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect these majestic animals. Many wildlife reserves and sanctuaries in India have taken steps to preserve the habitat of the blackbuck and ensure their survival for future generations to enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        The jangli rami, or blackbuck, is a truly magnificent creature that symbolizes the beauty and diversity of India's wildlife. With their graceful appearance and impressive speed, blackbucks are a sight to behold in their natural habitat. It is essential to continue efforts to protect and conserve these animals so that they can thrive for years to come.
