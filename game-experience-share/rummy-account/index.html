    <h1>The Fascinating Game of Rummy</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by people all over the world for many years. It is a game of skill, strategy, and luck that can be played with 2 to 6 players. The objective of the game is to form sets and sequences of cards in your hand to win points. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and a printed joker.</p>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy:</h2>

    <p>Each player is dealt a set number of cards, depending on the variation of the game being played. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw pile, and the top card is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile. Players take turns to draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and then discard a card from their hand. The goal is to form sets and sequences of cards before your opponents do.</p>

    <h2>Sets and Sequences:</h2>

    <p>A set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, such as 7 of hearts, 7 of diamonds, and 7 of clubs. A sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit, such as 5 of hearts, 6 of hearts, and 7 of hearts. Players can also use wild cards or jokers to substitute any card in a set or sequence.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game:</h2>

    <p>The game continues until a player forms sets and sequences with all the cards in their hand and declares "Rummy". The other players then have to count the points in their hands based on the cards they have not been able to group into sets or sequences. The player with the least points wins the game.</p>

    <h2>Variations of Rummy:</h2>

    <p>There are many variations of the game such as Indian Rummy, Gin Rummy, and Kalooki Rummy, each with its own set of rules and strategies. Indian Rummy, for example, requires players to form at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence without any jokers.</p>
