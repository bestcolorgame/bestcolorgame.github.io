<h1>Total Cards in Rummy</h1>

<p>Rummy is a popular card game that is played worldwide. The game is typically played with a standard deck of 52 cards, with the jokers included. The number of cards used in rummy can vary depending on the variant being played, but the standard deck consists of 52 cards which are divided into four suits - hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.</p>

<p>In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>13 cards in each suit - hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades</li>
  <li>Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) and numbered cards (2-10)</li>
  <li>Two joker cards (wild cards) - usually a red joker and a black joker</li>
</ul>
