    <h1>The Exciting World of Rummy Cards</h1>

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. It is a game of skill, strategy, and a little bit of luck that can be played with 2-6 players. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards and the objective is to form sets and runs of cards.</p>

    <h2>Types of Rummy Games:</h2>

    <p>There are many variations of the game, but some of the most popular ones include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indian Rummy:</strong> This is one of the most popular variants of rummy played in India. It is a card-melding game that involves making sequences and sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Gin Rummy:</strong> In this version, players aim to form sets and runs to declare as quickly as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Rummy 500:</strong> This is a form of rummy where players aim to reach a total score of 500 points by forming sets and runs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play Rummy:</h2>

    <p>The game begins with each player being dealt a certain number of cards from the deck. Players then take turns to draw and discard cards, with the goal of forming valid sets and runs. A set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank, and a run is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>
