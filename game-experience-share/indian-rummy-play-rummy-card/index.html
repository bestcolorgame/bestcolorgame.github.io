    <h2>How to Play Indian Rummy</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Each player is dealt 13 cards at the beginning of the game.</li>
        <li>The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to form the draw and discard piles.</li>
        <li>Players take turns to draw a card from the discard pile or the draw pile and then discard a card they don't need.</li>
        <li>The objective is to form valid sequences and sets. A sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit, and a set is a group of three or four cards of the same rank but different suits.</li>
        <li>The game continues until a player declares by forming valid sequences and sets.</li>
        <li>The other players then have to show their cards and calculate their points based on the ungrouped cards in their hand.</li>
        <li>The player with the least number of points wins the game.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Tips for Playing Indian Rummy</h3>

        <li>Keep a close eye on the cards your opponents pick and discard to understand their strategies.</li>
