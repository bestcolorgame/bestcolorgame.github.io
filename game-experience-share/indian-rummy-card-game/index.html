    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (18).jpg" alt="Rummy Cards" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%;">

    <p>Rummy is a popular card game that has been played for centuries in India. It is a skill-based game that requires strategy, quick thinking, and a good memory. Indian Rummy, also known as Paplu, is a variation of the classic Rummy game that is played with two decks of cards and two jokers.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #FF5733;">How to Play Indian Rummy:</h2>

    <p>To play Indian Rummy, each player is dealt 13 cards, and the objective is to form valid sets and sequences with the cards in hand. A valid set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank but different suits, and a valid sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>

    <p>Players take turns to draw and discard cards to form their sets and sequences. The game continues until one player declares by forming valid sets and sequences and then discarding their 14th card. The other players must then reveal their cards, and points are calculated based on the cards they are left with.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #FF5733;">Rules of Indian Rummy:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Each player must draw a card from the closed or open deck and then discard a card to the open deck in each turn.</li>
        <li>A player must have at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence (without a joker).</li>
        <li>Any player declaring without having met the above conditions is penalized with a high score.</li>
        <li>Jokers can be used to replace any missing card in a set or sequence.</li>
        <li>The ace can be used as a high or low card in sequences (e.g., K-A-2).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #FF5733;">Benefits of Playing Indian Rummy:</h2>

    <p>Playing Indian Rummy has several benefits, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Improving cognitive skills such as memory, concentration, and strategic thinking.</li>
        <li>Enhancing social skills through interaction with other players.</li>
        <li>Reducing stress and providing entertainment and relaxation.</li>
        <li>Boosting confidence and decision-making abilities.</li>
    </ul>
