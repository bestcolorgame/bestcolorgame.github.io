This includes knowing the primary colours (red, blue, yellow), secondary colours (green, orange, purple), and how they interact with each other. Comprehending these basics will allow you to make more educated guesses and predictions when faced with colour-related choices.</p>

        <h2>Analyze Patterns</h2>
