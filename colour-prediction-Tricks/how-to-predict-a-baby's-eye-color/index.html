        <h1>Predicting Your Baby's Eye Color</h1>
        <p>Many expectant parents are curious about what their baby will look like, with eye color being one of the most popular traits. Eye color is determined by multiple genes and can sometimes be predicted with a fair degree of accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Genetics of Eye Color</h2>
        <p>Eye color is primarily influenced by the pigmentation of the iris and the way light scatters around it. Genes involved determine the amount of melanin in the iris. The more melanin, the darker the eye color. Melanin production can increase over time, which is why some babies born with blue eyes might end up with green, hazel, or brown eyes as they age.</p>
        <p>Most commonly, eye color is explained through the basic principles of Mendelian genetics, though this explanation is simplified. Two main genes, OCA2 and HERC2, located on chromosome 15, play a crucial role in the production and storage of melanin.</p>

        <h2>Basic Rules of Prediction</h2>
        <p>The traditional model states that each parent contributes one allele (form of a gene) to their child. Here's how it generally works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brown</strong> is usually dominant over green and blue.</li>
            <li><strong>Green</strong> tends to be dominant over blue.</li>
            <li><strong>Blue</strong> is generally recessive, meaning both genes need to be blue for the eyes to be blue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using a Punnett Square</h2>
        <p>A tool commonly used to predict eye color is the Punnett Square, which helps visualize how different alleles from each parent may combine. For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the eye colors and probable genes of both parents.</li>
            <li>Draw a square divided into four.</li>
            <li>Place one parent's two possible alleles on the top and the other's on the side.</li>
            <li>Fill in the square to see all possible genetic combinations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Consider all combinations: BB (Brown/Brown), BG (Brown/Green), etc., and their associated eye colors.</p>

        <h2>Limitations and Modern Genetic Testing</h2>
        <p>While these methods can provide a basic idea, predicting eye color can be more complicated because itâ€™s controlled by many genes. Additionally, interactions between different genes and the environment may affect eye color.</p>
        <p>For those interested in a more accurate prediction, genetic testing can provide more specific insights. This testing evaluates DNA from a cheek swab or blood test, looking at multiple genes that influence eye color.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Predicting your baby's eye color can be fun, but remember, many genetic factors can influence the final outcome. Thus, while predictions can provide a guess, they are not always guaranteed. The joy of waiting to see what color eyes your baby will have is part of the magical experience of parenthood.</p>
