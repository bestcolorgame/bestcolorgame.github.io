    <p>Pay attention to the colors they often choose for their clothing, accessories, and personal items. People usually gravitate towards colors they like when it comes to their possessions. For example, if you notice someone frequently wearing blue shirts or buying blue decor, there's a good chance they are fond of the color blue.</p>

    <p>During conversations, listen for any clues they might drop about their color preferences. They might express admiration for a particular color when discussing art, movies, nature, or fashion. These offhand remarks can be very telling about their color preferences.</p>

    <h2>Check Their Social Media</h2>
