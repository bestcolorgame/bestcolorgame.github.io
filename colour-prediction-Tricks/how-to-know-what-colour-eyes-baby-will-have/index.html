    <h1>How to Predict Your Baby's Eye Color</h1>
    <p>One of the exciting aspects of expecting a new baby is guessing which features they will inherit from each parent. Eye color, one of the traits influenced by genetics, can be especially interesting to predict. This article explores the science behind eye color determination and the factors that can influence the final shade of your baby's eyes.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Genetics of Eye Color</h2>
    <p>Eye color is primarily determined by the amount and distribution of melanin within the iris, regulated by several genes, with the two main ones being OCA2 and HERC2 located on chromosome 15. These genes interact in complex ways, resulting in the variety of eye colors seen in humans.</p>

    <h3>The Basic Genetics</h3>
    <p>Traditionally, it was believed that eye color inheritance was a simple Mendelian trait, where brown eyes were dominant over blue eyes. However, we now understand that the genetics of eye color is influenced by multiple genes, not just one.</p>

    <p>For example, if both parents have blue eyes, the child is likely to also have blue eyes, but this is not guaranteed due to the polygenic nature of eye color.</p>

    <h2>Predicting Eye Color</h2>
    <p>Several online calculators and charts can predict eye color based on the eye colors of parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. These tools use algorithms that consider the complexities of multiple gene interactions.</p>

    <h3>Factors Influencing Eye Color</h3>
    <p>While genetics play a pivotal role, there are other factors that can influence the pigmentation of the iris, potentially altering the predicted eye color:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> New genetic mutations can occur, which are not inherited from the parents.</li>
        <li><strong>Epigenetics:</strong> Factors that affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence can also impact eye color.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can Eye Color Change Over Time?</h2>
    <p>It's common for babies to be born with blue or gray eyes, only for them to darken as the child grows. This change occurs as melanin, which is initially absent, starts being deposited in the iris. The process can take up to three years to complete.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions and Anomalies</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, a person can have two different eye colors, a condition known as heterochromia. Other anomalies, such as aniridia, where the iris is partially or entirely absent, can also affect eye color.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Predicting your baby's eye color can be a fun exercise, but it is important to remember that many factors can influence the outcome. Genetics provides a basis, but the final color can sometimes be a surprise.</p>
    <p>Whatever the color, your baby's eyes will no doubt be one of their most captivating features. Enjoy the wonder of discovering all the unique traits your baby will bring!</p>
