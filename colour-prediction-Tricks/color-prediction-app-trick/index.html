        <img src="/images/colorGame/images (51).jpg" alt="Color Prediction App Interface">
        <p>At its core, a color prediction app runs on an algorithm that selects colors in a seemingly random order. This algorithm is designed to integrate a balance of unpredictability and probability statistics that make predictions tough but not impossible. Usually, games involve multiple colors, with each having a specific probability of being chosen by an algorithm based on its underlying code.</p>
