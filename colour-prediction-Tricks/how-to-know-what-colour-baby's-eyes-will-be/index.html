    <h1>Predicting Your Baby's Eye Color</h1>
    <p>One of the most exciting aspects for expecting parents is wondering what their baby will look like. Eye color, in particular, can be a fascinating trait to think about. While it is largely determined by genetics, predicting the exact shade can be a bit tricky.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Genetics Behind Eye Color</h2>
    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (72).jpg" alt="Genetics Eye Color Chart" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Eye color is primarily affected by the pigmentation of the iris and the way light scatters through it. Genetically, this trait is influenced mainly by two genes: OCA2 and HERC2, located on chromosome 15. These genes determine the amount and quality of melanin in the iris. Generally, more melanin leads to darker eye colors (brown or black), while less results in lighter colors (blue, green, or gray).</p>

    <h3>The Basic Genetics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brown:</strong> Dominant trait. A baby is likely to have brown eyes if at least one parent has brown eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Less common than brown, green eyes are considered recessive but can dominate over blue eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Both parents need to pass blue-eye genes to their child for blue eyes to occur, making it recessive to both brown and green.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Predictive Factors</h2>
    <p>While parent’s eye colors can provide some insight, it is not a definitive predictor. This is due to the multiple genes involved, some of which may be recessive and only show up after several generations.</p>

    <h3>Punnett Square Analysis</h3>

    <p>A Punnett Square can help illustrate how different genes from each parent might combine. However, this model simplifies the genetic complexities and should only be used as a possible indicator.</p>

    <h3>Changing Eye Color</h3>
    <p>It's important to note that many Caucasian babies are born with blue or gray eyes, due to low melanin concentration at birth. However, this can change over the following months as melanin production increases, eventually stabilizing to their permanent color typically by the age of three.</p>

    <h2>Can We Predict Exact Eye Color?</h2>
    <p>Although tools and charts can guess a baby’s potential eye color based on genetic inheritance, there are still many genetic factors and potential mutations which might affect the outcome. It's also possible for siblings to have different eye colors entirely.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While genetics provide a map, the prediction of exact eye color before a child's birth remains an imperfect science. The development of eye color is a fascinating example of genetics at play and can surprise even seasoned geneticists.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, whatever the eye color, it will be just one part of your baby’s unique beauty.</p>
