        <h2>How to Play a Basic Color Prediction Game</h2>
        <p>Here's a simple setup for a hands-on color prediction game, which you can play almost anywhere:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gather Materials:</strong> You'll need multicolored papers or objects, paper bags, and a recording sheet for keeping score.</li>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Place each colored object or piece of paper in a different bag. Shake the bags so the color objects inside are not visible from outside.</li>
            <li><strong>Playing the Game:</strong> Each player guesses the color they believe is inside each bag and records their prediction on the sheet. Players can shake the bag or feel the objects inside but cannot look.</li>
            <li><strong>Reveal and Score:</strong> Open the bags to reveal the colors. Players get points for every correct prediction. The player with the most points wins!</li>
        </ol>
