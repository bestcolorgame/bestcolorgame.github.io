    <h1>Discovering Colors That Suit You Best</h1>
    <p>Finding the right colors to wear can enhance your overall appearance, complementing your skin tone, eyes, and hair. This guide helps you explore the best colors according to your personal attributes and provide strategies for experimenting with color.</p>

    <h2>Determine Your Skin Tone</h2>
    <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T202323.528.jpg" alt="Skin Tone Chart" class="guide-img">
    <p><strong>Cool Skin Tones:</strong> If you have pink, red, or bluish undertones, silver jewelry tends to complement your skin. Cool-skinned individuals often have blue, gray, or green eyes and blond, brown, or black hair with silver tones. Colors like blue, lavender, rose, and gray will generally look flattering on you.</p>

    <p><strong>Warm Skin Tones:</strong> Those with yellow, peachy, golden undertones, and who look better in gold jewelry typically fall into this category. They might have amber, brown, or hazel eyes with strawberry blond, red, brown, or black hair with gold tones. Consider wearing earth tones such as reds, oranges, yellows, and olive greens.</p>

    <p><strong>Neutral Skin Tones:</strong> You may have a mix of warm and cool undertones, or your undertones are the same as your actual skin tone. Neutral-toned individuals typically look good in most colors but can enhance their features with jade green, mocha, oyster, and blue-gray.</p>

    <h2>Seasonal Color Analysis</h2>

    <p>Another popular method to find flattering colors is the seasonal color analysis, which categorizes individual palettes into four seasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Light, warm tones like peach, coral, golden yellow, and bright greens.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Soft, cool hues such as baby blue, lavender, plum, and pale pinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Rich, warm shades like olive, orange, gold, and dark browns.</li>
        <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Bold, cool colors including sapphire, emerald, white, and intense blues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experiment With Your Wardrobe</h2>
    <p>Understanding theory is one thing, but the true test comes when you try different colors on yourself. If you're unsure about a new color, start with small items like a scarf or a tie. See how they work with your skin tone in various lighting conditions.</p>

    <h2>Consider Your Hair and Eye Color</h2>
    <p>Your hair and eye color can also influence how a color looks on you. For example, people with dark hair and light eyes might look phenomenal in high contrast clothing, while those with light hair and eyes might suit pastel and muted shades.</p>

    <h2>Personal Preference Matters</h2>
    <p>While all these guidelines can provide a starting point, your personal preference is crucial. Wear colors that make you feel confident and happy. Over time, you will naturally gravitate towards shades that not only look good on you but also reflect your personality.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Discovering the colors that best suit you involves understanding your skin tone, trying out various shades, and considering your personal style. By experimenting and seeing how different colors affect your mood and appearance, you can build a wardrobe that truly enhances your best features.</p>
