    <h1>Predicting Your Baby's Hair Color</h1>
    <p>One of the exciting aspects of waiting for the arrival of a new baby is wondering what they will look like. Will they have curly hair? What color will their eyes be? Among these questions, predicting the color of a baby's hair is a common curiosity for parents-to-be. Let's explore how genetics play a role in determining hair color and how you might be able to make an educated guess about your future child's hair color.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Genetics</h2>
    <p>Before diving into predictions, it's important to understand the basic science behind genetics and hair color. Hair color is primarily determined by the amount and type of melanin, a pigment produced by melanocytes. Humans have two main types of melanin that influence hair color: eumelanin (which can be black or brown) and pheomelanin (which is reddish-yellow).</p>

    <h3>The Role of Genes</h3>
    <p>Multiple genes are involved in the determination of a person's hair color, the most significant of which are MC1R, which influences the amount of pheomelanin produced, and genes in the tyrosinase (TYR) family, which affect the production of eumelanin. Variations in these genes can lead to a wide spectrum of hair color.</p>

    <h2>Making Predictions</h2>
    <p>Predicting hair color based on parents' hair color can be fun but is not always accurate due to the complex nature of genetics. Here's a simplified way to make a guess:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Both parents have similar hair colors:</strong> There's a higher chance their baby will inherit a similar hue.</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed hair colors:</strong> If one parent has light hair and the other dark, the possibilities widen. Typically, darker genes are more dominant, but blending can occur.</li>
        <li><strong>Recessive traits:</strong> Even if both parents have darker hair, the possibility of a recessive gene (like red hair associated with the MC1R gene) appearing in their child is still there if there is a familial history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Punnett Square - A Tool for Prediction</h2>
    <p>A Punnett square can offer a visual representation of how different traits might combine. Here's a simplified example modeling potential outcomes of parental genes combining for hair color:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Mother (Brown)</th>
                <th>Mother (Brown)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Father (Blonde)</td>
                <td>Brown</td>
                <td>Brown</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Father (Blonde)</td>
                <td>Blonde/Brown Mix</td>
                <td>Blonde/Brown Mix</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>It's crucial to recognize that such predictions are not definitive. This is because hair color can change over time. Many babies are born with lighter hair that darkens as they age. Moreover, genetic variations are vast and unpredictable, meaning two children from the same parents can have different hair colors.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In the end, predicting your babyâ€™s hair color is just an educated guess based on genetic principles. Regardless of the color of their hair, the arrival of a new baby brings joy and a unique set of traits that make them one-of-a-kind.</p>
