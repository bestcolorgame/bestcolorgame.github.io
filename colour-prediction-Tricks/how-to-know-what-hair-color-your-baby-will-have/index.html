    <h1>Predicting Your Baby's Hair Color</h1>
    <p>Many expectant parents are curious about what their baby will look like, including details as specific as the hair color. While it's not possible to determine this with 100% accuracy before the baby is born, genetics give us some clues to make an educated guess. Here’s a basic guide to understanding the genetics behind hair color and how it might play out in your soon-to-be-born baby.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding Genetics of Hair Color</h2>
    <p>Human hair color is primarily determined by the type and amount of melanin, which is the pigment that also affects skin and eye color. The genetics behind hair color are complex because they involve multiple genes, and the interaction between these genes is not fully predictable. However, the two main types of melanin in hair are eumelanin (black or brown) and pheomelanin (reddish-yellow).</p>

    <p>The genes that are chiefly responsible for the development of hair color are MC1R, which controls the type of melanin being produced, and other genes such as TYR, OCA2, and HERC2, which influence the amount of melanin. However, different combinations of alleles, or forms of a gene, can lead to a wide variety of hair colors, ranging from black to blonde, and red to brown.</p>
    
    <h2>Predicting Your Baby’s Hair Color</h2>
    <p>Both parents contribute one allele for each gene to their child. The combination of these alleles will determine the child’s hair color. Generally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If both parents are brunette, they could have a child with hair ranging from brunette to blonde, depending on the combination of alleles the child inherits.</li>
        <li>If one parent is blonde and the other brunette, there’s a chance for the child to have blonde hair, but it is more likely they will have brown hair.</li>
        <li>Red hair results from two recessive alleles of the MC1R gene but can occur unexpectedly if both parents carry recessive alleles, even if neither parent has red hair.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's also important to remember that hair color can change over time. Many babies with fair hair darken as they grow older. The ultimate color is usually not set until a child is about one to two years old.</p>

    <h2>Limitations and Exceptions</h2>
    <p>Genetic predictions are not always accurate. Spontaneous mutations and the complex interaction of multiple genes can lead to unexpected hair colors. Furthermore, environmental factors, hormones, and aging also play a significant role in hair pigmentation.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While predicting your baby's hair color can be a fun exercise, it's important to remember that genetics are incredibly complex, and many factors can influence the final outcome. No matter what hair color your baby ends up with, it will surely be a wonderful part of who they are.</p>
