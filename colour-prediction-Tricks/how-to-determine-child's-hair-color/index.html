    <h1>How to Determine Your Child's Hair Color</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wondered what determines the color of your child’s hair? Believe it or not, your little one’s locks are the result of a complex interplay of genetics. Below, we explore how genetics influence hair color, provide insight into the possibilities of your child's hair color, and discuss whether hair color can change over time.</p>

    <h2>The Genetics of Hair Color</h2>
    <img src="/images/colorGame/colour.jpg" alt="DNA strands">
    <p>Hair color is primarily determined by the type and amount of melanin, a pigment, present in the hair. The two main types of melanin in human hair are eumelanin (which can be black or brown) and pheomelanin (which is red). The combination and amount of these pigments, controlled by multiple genes, dictate the spectrum of hair color from black to blonde through to red.</p>

    <h3>Key Genes Involved in Hair Color:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MC1R:</strong> The melanocortin 1 receptor gene has a significant influence, especially in determining whether someone has red hair and fair skin. Variations in this gene can reduce the amount of eumelanin produced, increasing the red pigment, pheomelanin.</li>
        <li><strong>OCA2 and HERC2:</strong> These genes influence the production of melanin and are largely responsible for shades from blue to brown in eyes and light to dark shades in hair.</li>    
    </ul>

    <h2>Predicting Your Child's Hair Color</h2>
    <p>Understanding the exact hair color your child will have can be complicated because it involves multiple genes. However, we can still predict some patterns based on parental genetics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Both parents have similar hair color:</strong> There is a higher likelihood that the child will inherit a similar shade, but variations are always possible due to recessive genes.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents with differing hair colors:</strong> The outcome can be more diverse. For example, if one parent is blonde and the other is brunette, the child might inherit a light brown or dark blonde color.</li>
        <li><strong>Red hair:</strong> Typically, both parents must carry the gene for red hair, even if neither parent actually has red hair themselves.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>An interesting aspect to note is the phenomenon known as 'incomplete dominance' where neither gene is completely dominant over the other. An example is a child with one blonde-haired parent and one brunette parent having light brown or strawberry blonde hair as the melanin genes blend characteristics from both parents.</p>

    <h2>Can a Child's Hair Color Change Over Time?</h2>
    <p>Yes, it is quite common for babies to experience changes in hair color. For instance, a baby born with dark hair might end up with a much lighter hair color as they grow older. This is often due to changes in the amount and type of melanin produced as the child develops.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, environmental factors, nutrition, and exposure to sunlight can all influence changes to a child’s hair color as they grow.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While it’s fascinating to predict your child’s hair color, it’s important to remember that these predictions are not guaranteed, as genetic variations are complex and not fully predictable. The wonder of genetics means that each child’s features are a unique blend of both parents, contributing to their individual uniqueness.</p>
