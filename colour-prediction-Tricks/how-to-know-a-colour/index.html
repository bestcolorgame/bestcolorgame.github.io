    <h1>Understanding Colors: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
    <p>
        Colors play a significant role in our daily lives. They can influence mood, communicate information, and even affect decisions. But what exactly is color, and how do we perceive it? This article will explore the basics of color knowledge, including its properties, the science behind it, and how humans perceive different colors.

    <section>
        <h2>What is Color?</h2>
        <p>
            At its core, color is the way that light behaves when it hits an object and is reflected back to our eyes. This perception of color stems from the wavelengths of light that are either absorbed or reflected by objects.

    <section>
        <h2>The Science of Color</h2>
        <p>
            Light exists in a spectrum of wavelengths, each of which corresponds to a different color. The wavelengths range from short, high-energy waves (like blue and violet) to long, low-energy waves (like red). When light hits an object, some wavelengths are absorbed while others are reflected. The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color of the object.

        <h2>Human Perception of Color</h2>
        <p>
            Humans perceive color through cells in the retina called cones. There are three types of cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light: short (blue), medium (green), and long (red). This is why these three colors are known as the primary colors of light. The combination and intensity of these wavelengths determine the color we see.

        <h2>Colors and Emotions</h2>
        <p>
            Different colors can evoke different feelings and responses. For example, red is often associated with energy and passion, while blue can evoke feelings of calm and serenity. Understanding the psychological effects of color can be very useful in marketing, art, and design.

        <h2>Practical Applications of Color Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
            Knowing how colors can affect people can be invaluable in various fields. In marketing, colors can influence buyer behaviors; in interior design, they can affect the mood of a room; in fashion, they can enhance personal style; and in art, they can convey deep symbolism.
