    <h1>Understanding Eye Color Genetics</h1>
    <p>Eye color is a fascinating genetic trait influenced by the interplay of multiple genes. This article explores how these genes determine eye color, the different possible shades, and common patterns in inheritance.</p>
    
    <h2>The Genetics Behind Eye Color</h2>
    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (18).png" alt="Genetic Determinants of Eye Color">
    <p>Traditionally, it was believed that eye color was a simple Mendelian trait, where brown eyes were dominant over blue eyes. However, modern science shows that multiple genes are involved, making the genetics of eye color far more complex.</p>
    <p>The main genes associated with eye color include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OCA2:</strong> This gene, located on chromosome 15, contributes primarily to pigment production. Variations in this gene can lead to different eye colors depending on the amount of melanin produced in the iris.</li>
        <li><strong>HERC2:</strong> Located near the OCA2, it influences how OCA2 is expressed and can lead to blue eyes when certain mutations reduce pigment production.</li>
        <li><strong>Other genes:</strong> Several other genes cause variations in eye color, such as SLC24A4 and TYR. They each add layers of complexity to eye color variations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Eye Colors and Their Genetic Roots</h2>
    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (13).jpg" alt="Eye Color Chart">
    <p>Eye colors range widely from the most common brown to the least common green. Hereâ€™s a brief guide to the genetics of each eye color:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brown:</strong> Often dominant, this color results from higher concentrations of melanin in the iris. Variants in OCA2 and HERC2 typically lead to this eye color.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Blue eyes result from lower melanin concentration and light scattering in the iris. Mutations in HERC2 lead to reduced pigmentation, facilitating this eye color.</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Less melanin than brown but more than blue, green eyes often result from a specific mutation in the TYR gene combined with other factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazel and other variations:</strong> These colors result from different combinations of melanin concentration and the pattern within the iris. Multiple gene interactions typically influence these hues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Patterns of Inheritance</h2>
    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (99).jpg" alt="Eye Color Inheritance Patterns">
    <p>Eye color inheritance is not as straightforward as once believed. While it is true that darker colors are often dominant, the interaction between multiple genes can create a variety of outcomes, even within the same family.</p>
    <p>Therefore, predicting a child's eye color based on parent's eyes requires understanding the specific genetic combinations passed to the child, which might include hidden recessive genes influencing eye color.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While the science of eye color genetics is complex, understanding it helps illuminate the fascinating world of genetics and human variation. Each eye color results from a unique genetic tapestry, reflecting the rich genetic heritage each person carries.</p>
