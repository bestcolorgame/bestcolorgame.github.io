    <h1>Understanding Colors: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
    <p>
        Color is all around us, shaping our thoughts, emotions, and actions in subtle, yet powerful ways. Whether you’re designing a room, creating art, or just curious about colors, knowing how to identify and understand colors can greatly enhance your daily experiences. Here’s a basic guide on how to recognize different colors and their characteristics.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Color?</h2>
    <p>
        Color is the aspect of things that is caused by differing qualities of light being reflected or emitted by them. To see color, we need light. When light shines on an object some colors bounce off the object and others are absorbed by it. Our eyes only see the colors that are bounced off or reflected.
    </p>

    <h2>Identifying Colors</h2>
    <p>
        The color we see is determined by the color spectrum, which includes a wide range of colors visible to the human eye. These are often categorized into seven basic colors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Red</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Yellow</li>
        <li>Green</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
        <li>Indigo</li>
        <li>Violet</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to Know the Color</h2>
    <h3>Using Basic Observation Skills</h3>
    <p>
        The simplest way to know an object’s color is through observation in natural light. Artificial light sources can alter how a color appears. If possible, observe the color of the object outdoors on a clear sunny day when sunlight is abundant.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Understanding Color Context</h3>
    <p>
        Colors can look different depending on their context. For example, a red apple might look darker against a light background and brighter against a dark background. Always consider the surrounding colors and lighting when determining the color of an object.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Using Color Tools</h3>
    <p>
        For more precision, tools like color wheels or mobile apps can be used. Color wheels show the relationship between colors and can help in identifying complementary and analogous colors. Applications for smartphones such as color identifier apps use your phone’s camera to determine and name the color you point it at.

    <h2>Learning Color Theory</h2>
    <p>
        Basic color theory refers to the rules and guidelines through which colors are used and combined in art and design. These rules can help you understand the emotional and visual implications of your color choices. 
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> Red, yellow, and blue – cannot be made by mixing other colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> Green, orange, and purple – made by mixing two primary colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> Created by mixing primary and secondary shades (e.g., yellow-orange).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Practical Applications for Everyday Decisions</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding colors can help you in daily life decisions like choosing suitable clothing, decorating your home, or even planting a garden that is aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Colors play a vital role in all aspects of life. By applying a few of these tips, you can enhance your ability to observe and use colors more effectively. Whether for personal or professional use, knowing colors can considerably enhance your experiences and project outcomes.
