        <h2>Understanding the Basics of Colour Prediction Games</h2>
        <p>Colour prediction games are popular in many arcades and gaming halls, such as Mantri Mall. Players predict which color will appear next, often on a spinning wheel or digital interface. Success in these games can sometimes seem based on luck, but there are strategies that can improve your chances.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Tips for Colour Prediction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Observe Before You Play:</strong> Watch the game for a few rounds before you start playing. Note any patterns or frequently appearing colours.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose Less Frequent Colours:</strong> Often, less frequent colours might have a higher reward multiplier. Riskier bets can sometimes lead to higher rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Set a Budget:</strong> Before you start, decide how much money you are willing to lose. Stick to this budget strictly, irrespective of wins or losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Play During Less Busy Hours:</strong> Try playing during off-peak hours when fewer people are playing. This can sometimes affect the randomness of the outcomes, potentially improving your odds.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the Martingale Strategy:</strong> This betting strategy involves doubling your bet after every loss. It is risky, but it can pay off quickly once you win. Make sure you have a significant budget to follow through with this strategy.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Avoid Common Pitfalls</h2>
        <p>While engaging in colour prediction, it’s easy to fall into habitual patterns or let emotions drive your decisions. Here's how you can avoid that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not chase losses — stepping away when things aren’t going your way is a smart strategy.</li>
            <li>Avoid alcoholic beverages while playing, as they can impair judgment and lead to poor decisions.</li>
            <li>Keep track of time. It’s easy to get caught up in the fast-paced action of gaming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legal and Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>Always ensure that participating in betting games, such as colour prediction, is legal in your locality. Gambling can be addictive, so it's important to engage responsibly and seek help if you feel you are developing a gambling problem.</p>
