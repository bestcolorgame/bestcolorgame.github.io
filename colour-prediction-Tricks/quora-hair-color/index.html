        <h1>Hair Color Trends and Tips</h1>
        
        <p>Changing your hair color can be exciting and uplifting. The right shade can enhance your mood, complement your skin tone, and display your personality. Below, we explore the latest hair color trends and provide essential tips for maintaining vibrant hair at every shade.</p>
        
        <!-- Balayage -->

        <p class="image-text">Example of a blonde balayage hairstyle</p>
        <p>Balayage continues to dominate hair trends. This technique involves painting color directly onto the hair, creating a natural, graduated effect with beautiful dimensions. Itâ€™s particularly popular because it offers a low-maintenance upkeep, as the grow-out is less noticeable than with traditional highlights.</p>

        <!-- Vibrant Colors -->
        <h2>Vibrant Colors</h2>

        <p class="image-text">Bright and bold hair colors</p>
        <p>Vibrant and bold colors like pinks, blues, and neon shades are showing no signs of slowing down. These colors make a statement at any age and can be tailored to be as subtle or as vivid as you desire. Note, these shades may require more frequent touch-ups to maintain their luminosity.</p>

        <!-- Natural Roots -->
        <h2>Natural Roots</h2>

        <p>Embracing natural roots has become a trend embraced for its beauty and practicality. Many are choosing to let their natural hair color grow out a bit, creating a contemporary look that combines natural and enhanced colors, reducing frequent visitations to the hairstylist.</p>

        <!-- Hair Color Tips -->
        <h2>Hair Color Maintenance Tips</h2>
        <p>Maintaining hair color can be a challenge, but with the right care, your color can remain as vivid as the day it was dyed. Here are some tips to keep your hair healthy and your color vibrant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoid Frequent Washing:</strong> Washing your hair too frequently can strip away color and natural oils. Try to wash your hair 2-3 times a week and use dry shampoo in between if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Color-Safe Products:</strong> Invest in shampoos and conditioners formulated for color-treated hair. These products help maintain the color and prevent fading.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid High Heat:</strong> High temperatures from styling tools can fade hair color and damage hair. Use the lowest heat setting on your tools, and always apply a heat protectant.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Trims:</strong> Snip the ends regularly to avoid split ends which can make your hair color look dull and unhealthy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Whether you're considering a bold new color or sticking with subtle highlights, remember to consider your lifestyle, skin tone, and the amount of time you're willing to spend on maintenance. The right hair color can make a world of difference in how you look and feel, so choose wisely and have fun!</p>
