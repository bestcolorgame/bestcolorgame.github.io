    <h1>Understanding Your Color Analysis</h1>
    <p>Color analysis, also known as color typing or personal color analysis, is a method used to determine the colors that best suit an individual's natural coloring. The right colors can make you look healthier, more vibrant, and more put together, while the wrong colors can make you look tired, ill, or faded.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Color Analysis?</h2>
        <p>Color analysis revolves around identifying the colors that harmonize with your skin tone, hair color, and eye color. It is based on seasonal color analysis, which categorizes individual coloring into four main groups inspired by the seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. Each season corresponds to a set of characteristics and colors that enhance one's natural beauty.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How to Determine Your Color Season</h2>
        <p>Identifying which season you belong to can be done through a professional color analysis session or through some simple tests you can do at home:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Vein Test:</strong> Look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you likely have cool undertones. If they look green or olive, you probably have warm undertones.</li>
            <li><strong>The Silver/Gold Test:</strong> Hold a piece of silver and a piece of gold fabric or jewelry next to your face. Silver flatters cool undertones, and gold highlights warm undertones.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaction to Colors:</strong> Try on different colors of clothing near your face and notice which ones make your face look brighter and which make you look tired.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Seasonal Color Palettes</h2>
        <h3>Winter</h3>
        <p>Winters have cool undertones and are complemented by bold and clear colors like white, black, navy blue, and true red.</p>
        <h3>Spring</h3>
        <p>Springs have warm undertones with a clear, bright look. They look best in colors like peach, coral, golden yellow, and bright aqua.</p>
        <h3>Summer</h3>
        <p>Summers also have cool undertones but with a soft and muted look. They are enhanced by pastel and soft neutrals like soft pink, lavender, and light blue.</p>
        <h3>Autumn</h3>
        <p>Autumns have warm undertones with a rich and muted appearance. Earth tones like olive green, mustard yellow, and warm browns suit them well.</p>
