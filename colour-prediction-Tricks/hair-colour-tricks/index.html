        <h2>1. Choose the Right Shade</h2>
        <p>One of the most important hair colour tricks is selecting the right shade that complements your skin tone. For pale skin, cool tones like ash blonde or light mocha can work wonders. Those with warmer skin tones might love the richness of a honey blonde or a warm chestnut. Always consider consulting with a professional colorist to find the best match for you.</p> 

        <h2>2. Temporary Over Permanent</h2>
        <p>Not ready to commit to a permanent change? Experiment with temporary hair colors. These come in forms of shampoos, conditioners, and sprays that wash out after a few showers. This trick is perfect for those who love changing their looks frequently or want to try a bold color without long-term commitment.</p>

        <h2>3. Balayage</h2>
        <p>Balayage is a French colouring technique developed in the 1970s. It's a freehand technique where the color is applied by hand rather than using the traditional foiling or cap highlighting techniques. Balayage can be used in even the shortest pixie crop however the best results is in hair below the shoulders. The appeal of balayage is its utterly natural look that makes you look sun-kissed and radiant.</p>

        <h2>4. Maintenance Is Key</h2>
        <p>Once you've colored your hair, maintaining its vibrancy is essential. Use shampoos and conditioners formulated for color-treated hair. Avoid washing your hair with hot water as it opens up the cuticle of your hair and allows the color to wash out more easily. Instead, opt for lukewarm or cool water.</p>

        <h2>5. Root Conceal</h2>
        <p>As your hair grows, roots will eventually show up. A handy trick for extending the life of your overall color is to use a root touch-up product. These products can come in powder, spray, or even a mascara-like applicator. They're perfect for covering growth between color treatments.</p>

        <h2>6. Use Highlights and Lowlights</h2>
        <p>Adding highlights or lowlights can give your hair depth, dimension, and a multi-tonal look. Highlights involve lightening sections of your hair, whereas lowlights add darker tones. Both methods can help create an illusion of volume and texture.</p>
                
        <p>With these hair colour tricks, you can surely give your hair a new look that stands out. Always remember to conduct patch tests for new dyes to ensure you avoid any allergic reactions.</p>
