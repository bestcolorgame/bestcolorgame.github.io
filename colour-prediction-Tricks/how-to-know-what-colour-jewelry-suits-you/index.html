    <h1 class="title">How to Determine Which Color Jewelry Best Complements You</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Understanding Skin Tone</h2>
        <p>The first step in choosing the right color jewelry for you is understanding your skin tone. This is key because certain metals and gemstones complement different skin tones better than others. People typically have either a warm, cool, or neutral skin tone.</p>
        <img src="/images/colorGame/1_SEMEeuhDjWBQt_MgzM-xFw.jpg" alt="Skin Tone Chart">

        <p>Hereâ€™s how you can identify your skin tone:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cool Skin Tones:</b> If your veins appear blue or purple, you likely have cool skin tones. Silver, platinum, and white gold tend to look more flattering. Bright colors like blue, red, and purple also complement this skin tone.</li>
            <li><b>Warm Skin Tones:</b> If your veins look green or olive, you have a warm skin tone. Gold, copper, and brass jewelry look stunning on you. Earthy tones like green, orange, and yellow can enhance your appearance.</li>
            <li><b>Neutral Skin Tones:</b> If it's hard to determine the color of your veins, you might have a neutral skin tone. Most jewelry colors will be flattering on you, but muted shades can particularly highlight your versatility.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Considering Hair and Eye Color</h2>
        <p>Your eye and hair color can also influence which jewelry looks best. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individuals with dark hair and eyes might find that bold, dark pieces such as onyx or sapphire enhance their features.</li>
            <li>Those with light hair and eyes might prefer pastel colored gemstones like rose quartz or aquamarine.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Experiment with Personal Style and Preferences</h2>
        <p>While physical attributes like skin tone can guide you, personal taste should also play a significant role. Jewelry is an extension of your personality and should make you feel comfortable and confident.</p>
        <p>Experiment with different styles to see what you love the most. Whether you're drawn to minimalist designs or statement pieces, choosing jewelry that resonates with your personal aesthetic is crucial for feeling your best.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
