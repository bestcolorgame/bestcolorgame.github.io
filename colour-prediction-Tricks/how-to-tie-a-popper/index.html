Fishing enthusiasts often find tying their own flies a rewarding part of the fishing experience. The popper fly is especially popular for topwater fishing, attracting fish such as bass and pike with its popping sound. Here, we'll walk through the basic steps to tie your own popper, a skill that can enhance your fishing trips by allowing personal customization based on what the fish are biting on in your locale.

## Materials Needed

1. **Hook**: Size depends on the target species (e.g., 2/0 for large bass).
2. **Popper Body**: Foam or cork.
3. **Thread**: Strong, durable thread in a color that complements the popper body.
4. **Feathers and Fur**: For the tail. Common choices include marabou, bucktail, or synthetic materials.
5. **Paint and Brushes**: For customizing your popper with eyes, gills, etc.
6. **Super Glue or Epoxy**: To secure the popper body onto the hook.
7. **Tools**: Scissors, bobbin, bodkin, and a vice.

### Step 1: Prepare the Hook

Secure the hook in the vice with the point facing upwards. Make sure itâ€™s tight enough to hold the hook firmly in place but not so tight as to bend or damage it.

### Step 2: Attach the Thread

Start wrapping your thread at the eye of the hook, moving towards the bend. Make wraps tight and even to create a solid base for the other materials. Stop wrapping where you plan to place the popper body (usually near the middle of the shank).

### Step 3: Attaching the Tail

Choose your desired feathers or fur for the tail. Measure the tail so that it's typically about the length of the hook shank or slightly longer. Tie the materials at the point where you stopped your thread wraps, securing them with several tight wraps.

```

### Step 4: Fixing the Popper Body

Apply a small amount of super glue or epoxy on the area of the hook where the popper body will sit. Thread the popper body through the hook point and slide it down to rest on the glued area. Secure the body by wrapping more thread around the base of the body where it meets the hook. This ensures it won't spin or slide during casting.

```

### Step 5: Adding Details and Features

With the popper body in place, you can add extra features such as eyes or gills using paint. Allow the paint to dry completely. For added effects, tying in additional feathers, flash, or rubber legs around the collar of the popper can increase its attractiveness.

```

### Step 6: Finishing Touches

Finish your fly by securing all materials with several tight final wraps of thread behind the eye of the hook. Cut the thread, and apply a clear head cement to all the thread wraps to protect them and add durability.

## Conclusion

Tying your own popper flies can be a fun and engaging way to prepare for your next fishing adventure. Experiment with different colors, sizes, and materials to see what works best in your local waters. Remember to always handle hooks and other tools with care to avoid injury.

Happy fishing!
