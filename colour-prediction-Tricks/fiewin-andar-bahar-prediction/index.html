        <h2>Understanding Andar Bahar</h2>
        <p>Andar Bahar is traditionally played with a single deck of cards. The game starts with the dealer placing one card face up. This is called the 'Joker' or 'Game Card'. The goal is to predict whether a card with the same rank will appear on the 'Andar' (inside) or 'Bahar' (outside) side. Players place their bets based on their predictions.</p>
        
        <h2>Basics of Playing on FieWin</h2>

        <h2>Effective Prediction Strategies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Understand the Probabilities:</strong> Although Andar Bahar is a game of chance, understanding the probability of where the next card with the same rank will appear can be beneficial. It's roughly a 50/50 chance, but factors like how cards are dealt and shuffled can affect the outcome.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Your Bankroll:</strong> Always set a budget before you start playing. Decide on a maximum amount you are willing to lose, and stick to it. This will keep your finances under control regardless of the game's outcome.</li>
            <li><strong>Observe Patterns:</strong> Some players believe in identifying patterns in how cards are dealt on the platform. While thereâ€™s no scientific basis to guarantee success, some find this method helpful for making predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Advantage of Bonuses:</strong> FieWin provides bonuses and offers that can be used to play additional rounds. Using these can potentially increase your chances of winning without risking additional capital.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with small bets to understand the flow of the game.</li>
            <li>Take your time to make decisions, especially when placing bigger bets.</li>
            <li>Play consistently but avoid chasing losses if you are on a losing streak.</li>
            <li>Utilize platform features like history and statistics to inform your decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While there is no surefire way to always predict correctly in Andar Bahar, applying solid strategies and responsible gambling practices can improve your chances on platforms like FieWin. Remember to play smart, manage your funds wisely, and most importantly, have fun!</p>
