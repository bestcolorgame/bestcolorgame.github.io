        <li><strong>Guess the Color:</strong> Before drawing a card, each player must predict which color they think will come out of the bag next. They can announce their guess aloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw a Color:</strong> After all guesses have been made, one player goes ahead and draws a card from the bag.</li>
