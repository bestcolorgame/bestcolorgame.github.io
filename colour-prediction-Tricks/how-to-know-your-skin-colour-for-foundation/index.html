        <h1>Finding Your Perfect Foundation Shade</h1>
        <p>Choosing the right foundation shade can be a daunting task, but it's crucial for achieving a natural, flawless makeup look. Below are detailed steps to help you accurately determine your skin tone and undertone, ensuring you select the perfect match for your foundation.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Determine Your Skin Tone</h2>
        <p>Skin tone refers to the natural color of your complexion, which can range from fair to deep. Understanding your skin tone is the first step in selecting the right foundation color.</p>
        
        <!-- Example image for skin tone chart -->
        <!-- <img src="url_to_skin_tone_chart_image.jpg" alt="Skin Tone Chart"> -->

        <p>To determine your skin tone, observe your skin in natural daylight. Look at the most consistent color of your skin, typically found on your cheek or jawline.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Understand Your Undertone</h2>
        <p>Your skin's undertone is the underlying color that affects your overall hue. There are three main types of undertones: warm, cool, and neutral.</p>

        <!-- Example image for undertone examples -->
        <!-- <img src="url_to_undertone_image.jpg" alt="Examples of Undertones"> -->

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm undertones:</strong> Your skin has hints of yellow, peach or golden. Gold jewelry typically complements your skin better than silver.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool undertones:</strong> Your skin has hints of pink, red, or blue. Silver jewelry looks more flattering on your skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral undertones:</strong> Your skin does not have an obvious pink or yellow tone and is somewhere in between. Both gold and silver jewelry look good on you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To find your undertone, look at the veins on your wrist in natural light. If they appear green, you likely have warm undertones. If they look blue or purple, you likely have cool undertones. If it's hard to tell, you might have neutral undertones.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Testing Foundation Shades</h2>
        <p>Once you know your skin tone and undertone, test foundation shades that match. Test them along your jawline to ensure the color blends seamlessly with both your face and neck.</p>

        <!-- Example image for testing foundation -->
        <!-- <img src="url_to_testing_foundation_image.jpg" alt="Testing Foundation"> -->

        <p>Apply a stripe of foundation to your jawline, blend it in, and observe it in various lighting conditions, especially in natural light. The right shade should disappear into your skin and provide an even complexion without looking ashy or overly vivid.</p>

        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        <p>Remember, foundation can look different in the bottle as compared to your skin. Factors such as skin type, lighting, and even hormonal changes can affect how a shade looks on you. It's often recommended to get color-matched by a professional in a store, or to request samples to try at home.</p>
