        <h1>How to Determine Your Color Tone</h1>
        <p>Understanding your skin's color tone is essential for choosing clothing, makeup, and hair colors that complement your natural features. There are generally two main types of skin undertones: warm, cool, and a neutral category that falls in between. Here’s how you can identify yours.</p>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 1: The Vein Test</h2>
            <p>Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. Are they blue or green? If they appear more blue, you likely have cool undertones. If they appear more green (which is a result of the yellow tone of your skin mixing with the blue veins), then you have warm undertones. If it’s difficult to determine the color of your veins, you might have neutral undertones.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 2: The Sun Reaction Test</h2>
            <p>Think about how your skin reacts when it is exposed to the sun. Does your skin tan easily and rarely burn? That’s a typical sign of warm undertones. If your skin burns and rarely tans, you likely have cool undertones. If your skin tans gradually and sometimes burns, you might have neutral undertones.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 3: The Jewelry Test</h2>
            <p>Which type of jewelry complements your skin better – gold or silver? Typically, people with cool undertones look better in silver and platinum metals, and those with warm undertones look better in gold. If both suit you just fine, you likely have neutral undertones.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Step 4: The Color Test</h2>
            <p>Hold different colored fabrics up to your face and observe which ones make you look vibrant and healthy as opposed to washed out. Typically, warm undertones are complemented by earth tones like red, orange, yellow, and olive-green, while cool undertones are enhanced by blues, purples, and emerald greens. Neutral undertones often work well with most colors.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
            <p>Undertones are not the same as skin color. People of any skin color can have warm, cool, or neutral undertones, so focus specifically on these tests rather than comparing your skin color to someone else's.</p>
            <p>It may also be helpful to ask a friend to look at your tests, as an outside perspective might see things you don't. Alternatively, professional makeup stores often offer services to help determine your undertone and suggest colors and products that would suit you best.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Determining your skin's undertone is a crucial step in enhancing your overall look. By following these simple steps and perhaps consulting with a professional, you can make more informed choices about your wardrobe, makeup, and hair colors.</p>
