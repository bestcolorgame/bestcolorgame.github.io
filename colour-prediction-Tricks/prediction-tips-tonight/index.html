            <h2>Basketball: NBA Face-off</h2>
            <p>As the NBA season continues, tonight's spotlight is on the clash between the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers. Historical data shows the Lakers have struggled defensively when playing away. Coupled with the Heat's strong home record, predicting a win for Miami at home seems plausible.</p>

            <h2>Football: English Premier League Matchup</h2>
            <p>The fierce rivalry continues as Liverpool hosts Manchester United at Anfield. Liverpool's offensive prowess and high pressing when in possession could dominate United’s current shaky defence.</p>

                <strong>Prediction:</strong> High scoring game with a possible win for Liverpool.
            </div>

            <h2>Hockey: NHL Highlights</h2>
            <p>The Edmonton Oilers face off against the Calgary Flames in what is expected to be a fiery match. The Oilers’ key strength lies in their high-scoring ability, which could be critical in outmatching Calgary's robust defence.</p>
            <div class="prediction">
                <strong>Prediction:</strong> Close game, likely edge by Edmonton Oilers.
            </div>
            <p>Key Player to Watch: Connor McDavid. Dubbed a 'once-in-a-generation' talent, his playmaking skills will be vital in tonight’s game.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In conclusion, while predictions are made based on available data, the true beauty of sports lies in its unpredictability. Enjoy the games tonight, and may the best teams win!</p>
