        <h1>How to Determine Your Natural Hair Color</h1>
        <img src="/images/colorGame/1627455382642.jpg" alt="Hair color chart">

        <p>Determining your natural hair color can be important for various reasons, whether you're looking to match your hair dye to your original shade, or you're interested in understanding more about your genetics. Hereâ€™s how you can determine your natural hair color, especially if you've been coloring your hair for years.</p>

        <h2>Look at Childhood Photos</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to determine your natural hair color is by looking at photos from your early childhood. This is particularly effective if you have not started coloring your hair at that age. Look for patterns and shades that might give clues about your true hair color.</p>

        <h2>Examine Your Eyebrows and Eyelashes</h2>
        <p>Your eyebrows and eyelashes are good indicators of your natural hair color. They usually match or are a few shades darker than your natural hair. Note, however, that this method is not foolproof as some people naturally have contrasting hair and eyebrow colors.</p>

        <h2>Consult Your Parents or Older Relatives</h2>
        <p>If you're unsure, asking your parents or older relatives about what your hair was like as a child can be helpful. They may remember details about your original hair color and texture that you do not recall or were too young to notice.</p>

        <h2>Check the Roots</h2>
        <p>If you've been coloring your hair, check the color of your roots. The hair at your roots is generally a few weeks old, which is likely close to your natural hair color. However, this requires that you let your natural hair grow out for a few weeks.</p>

        <h2>Genetic Testing</h2>
        <p>If you are very curious about your genetic makeup, including what your natural hair color might be, you can use a genetic testing service. These services can provide insights based on your DNA, which can tell you about various traits, including your likely hair color category.</p>

        <h2>Professional Consultation</h2>
        <p>Consulting with a professional hairstylist can also yield good results. They can provide insights based on their expertise in hair colors and textures. A professional hairstylist can compare your root color to a hair color chart and help you identify your natural shade effectively.</p>

        <p>Understanding your natural hair color is a fascinating journey, and these methods can help you get closer to your roots, quite literally!</p>
