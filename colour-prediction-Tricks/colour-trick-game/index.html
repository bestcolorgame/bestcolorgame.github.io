            <h2>What is the Colour Trick Game?</h2>
            <p>The Colour Trick Game is a simple yet compelling mental challenge that involves correctly identifying the color of words, rather than the word text itself. This game is based on the famous Stroop Effect, a psychological phenomenon that demonstrates the interruption in reaction time when the color of words on a test and their meaning differ.</p>

            <h2>How to Play the Colour Trick Game</h2>
            <p>To play the game, players are shown a list of color names (like Red, Blue, Yellow), each of which is printed in a color that does not correspond to the name (for example, the word "Red" might be colored blue). The objective is to quickly say the color of the word’s font, not the word itself.</p>
