# How to Know What Hair Color Suits You

Choosing the right hair color can be a daunting task. With a dizzying array of shades available, how can you tell which one will best complement your appearance? Here are some key considerations to help you make the perfect choice.

## Understand Your Skin Tone

The first step in choosing hair color is to identify your skin tone. Skin tones are generally categorized into three types: warm, cool, and neutral.

- **Warm skin tones** have yellow, peachy, or golden undertones.
- **Cool skin tones** are identified by pink, red, or bluish undertones.
- **Neutral skin tones** have a mix of both warm and cool undertones or may not have any obvious undertones.

### **Test for Skin Tone**
- **The Vein Test**: Look at the veins in your wrist. If they appear green, you likely have a warm skin tone. If they look blue or purple, you probably have a cool skin tone.
- **The Jewelry Test**: Consider whether silver or gold jewelry looks better on you. Silver flatters cool tones, while gold shines best on warm tones.

## Consider Your Eye Color

Your eye color can also guide your choice of hair color. Typically:
- Those with blue or grey eyes might find cool hair colors suit them well such as platinum, ash blonde, or even cool brunette tones.
- Those with green, hazel, or brown eyes might suit warmer colors, such as golden blonde, honey, warm reds, or rich browns.

## Analyze Your Natural Hair Color

Your current or natural hair color also offers clues about what might suit you. It often indicates your natural contrast level (how much your hair naturally contrasts with your skin and eyes), which should ideally be maintained even when changing the hair color.

## Experiment with Temporary Colors

Before committing to a permanent change, try temporary hair dyes. This can give you an idea of how a color might look and how comfortable you feel with it.

## Seek Professional Advice

A professional hairstylist can provide personalized advice based on their experience and understanding of different colors and techniques. They can also consider factors you might not think of, such as hair texture and condition.

## Use Virtual Try-On Tools

Many beauty brands and apps now offer virtual try-on tools where you can see how different hair colors look on you through your smartphone or computer. This is a great way to experiment risk-free.

## General Tips:
- Lighter hair colors can brighten the complexion but may require more upkeep for dark natural hair.
- Darker hair colors can be striking and easier to maintain but may wash out paler skin tones.
- Vibrant and unusual colors like pastels, greens, and blues are fun but consider the maintenance and whether they meet dress codes at work or school.

By taking into account your skin tone, eye color, and natural hair color, experimenting cautiously with temporary colors, and possibly consulting a professional, you can find a hair color that enhances your natural beauty and boosts your confidence.
