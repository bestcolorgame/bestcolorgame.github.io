    <h1>Understanding Colour Prediction Rules in Design</h1>
    
    <img src="/images/colorGame/images (96).jpg" alt="Color Wheel and Theory">
    
    <p>
        Colour plays a crucial role in design, influencing perception and emotions. While the choice of colors can be subjective, there are established <strong>colour prediction rules</strong> that help designers create visually appealing and effective compositions. Whether it's graphic design, interior design, or fashion, understanding these rules can greatly enhance the impact of a design.
    </p> 
    
    <h2>1. The 60-30-10 Rule</h2>
    <p>
        A classic rule in interior design, the 60-30-10 rule is a timeless guideline that helps create balanced color schemes. This rule dictates that 60% of the room should be a dominant color, 30% a secondary color, and 10% an accent color. This principle helps create a sense of balance and allows the eye to move comfortably from one focal point to another.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Color Harmony</h2>
    <p>
        Harmony is key in color selection. Harmonious colors provide balance and a pleasing aesthetic. Some common methods to achieve color harmony include using analogous colors (colors that are next to each other on the color wheel), complementary colors (colors opposite on the color wheel), or a monochromatic scheme (different shades and tints of a single color).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Contrast and Legibility</h2>
    <p>
        Contrast is an essential aspect of designing readable content, especially in digital media. High contrast between text and background color ensures that content is legible. For example, black text on a white background offers the highest contrast. However, overly harsh contrasts can be fatiguing to the eyes, so many designers opt for softer contrasting colors that are easy on the eyes yet maintain legibility.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Psychological Effects of Colors</h2>
    <p>
        Colors can evoke different feelings, emotions, and actions from people, which is why they are so powerful in marketing and branding. For instance, red can evoke feelings of passion and urgency, often used in sale banners to attract buyers. Blue, on the other hand, is calming and can help to establish trust.
    </p>

    <p>
        Understanding color psychology and how different colors interact can help designers create more effective compositions. No matter what the project, applying these color prediction rules can lead to more cohesive, balanced, and appealing designs. Experimentation combined with these foundational guidelines allows for creative and impactful design solutions.
