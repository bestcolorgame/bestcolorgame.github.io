        <h1>Predicting Your Baby's Hair and Eye Color</h1>

        <p>Expecting parents often wonder about the physical traits their baby will inherit. Among the most common questions is, "What will my baby's hair and eye color be?" While genetics can provide clues, predicting these traits involves understanding complex genetic interactions.</p>
        
        <h2>About Genetic Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Both hair and eye color are primarily determined by the type and amount of pigments present in the body, dictated by multiple genes. The most well-known of these genes are those affecting melanin production, which can vary in amount and type, influencing color variation.</p>

        <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T205905.608.jpg" alt="Genetics inheritance diagram">

        <h2>Predicting Eye Color</h2>
        <p>Eye color is influenced by the balance of melanin in the iris. People typically think of the genetic model where brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes, but it's actually controlled by at least two genes and multiple alleles. The primary gene involved is OCA2, which contributes to pigment production, and HERC2, which can turn OCA2 on or off.</p>

        <p>A simplified way parents might predict eye color is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If both parents have blue eyes, the child will likely have blue eyes.</li>
            <li>If both parents have brown eyes, they might carry the blue-eyed gene recessively, and there is still a chance for blue-eyed children, especially if there is a family history.</li>
            <li>Mixed eye colors in parents, or the presence of green or hazel eyes, complicates predictions due to the polygenic nature of eye color inheritance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Predicting Hair Color</h2>
        <p>Like eye color, hair color is the result of the combination and interaction of multiple genes, with up to 16 genes playing a role in determining the amount and type of melanin in the hair shaft. The most influential genes include MC1R, which controls the type of melanin produced.</p>

        <p>The rules of hair color inheritance are similar to those for eye color:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two brown-haired parents can have a child with blonde hair if they both carry recessive blonde alleles.</li>
            <li>Red hair typically requires both parents to carry the gene, even if they don't express it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Factors</h2>
        <p>It is important to remember that genetic prediction can be influenced by other factors, including genetic mutations and the environmental influence on gene expression.</p>

        <p>Moreover, as science progresses, we understand more about how genetics are not strictly deterministic but interactive. The excitement of uncertainty is part of the joy of awaiting the arrival of a new family member.</p>
