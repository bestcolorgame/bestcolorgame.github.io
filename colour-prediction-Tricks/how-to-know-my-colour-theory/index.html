        <h1>Understanding Color Theory: A Beginner's Guide</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>Color theory is a fundamental area of design and art, providing guidance on the relationship between colors and the effects they create when combined or used alone. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive insight into color theory, looking at primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, as well as concepts like color harmony and the color wheel.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Color Wheel</h2>
        <p>The color wheel is a simple visual representation of colors arranged according to their chromatic relationship. For a helpful illustration, picture a typical artist's color wheel divided into various segments showing primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.</p>

        <figcaption><i>Figure 1: The Color Wheel.</i></figcaption>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Primary Colors</h2>
        <p>Primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors are the basis of all other colors on the color wheel and cannot be created by mixing other colors.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Secondary Colors</h2>
        <p>Secondary colors are green, orange, and violet, each formed by mixing two primary colors. For example, mixing blue and yellow makes green.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Tertiary Colors</h2>
        <p>Tertiary colors are the result of mixing a primary color with a secondary color next to it on the color wheel. Colors like red-orange and blue-green are examples of this.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Color Harmony</h2>
        <p>Color harmony involves combining colors in a way that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It's achieved using different methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complementary Colors:</strong> Colors opposite each other on the color wheel, such as blue and orange.</li>
            <li><strong>Analogous Colors:</strong> Colors next to each other on the color wheel, such as yellow, yellow-green, and green.</li>
            <li><strong>Triadic Colors:</strong> Three colors that are equally spaced around the color wheel, such as red, yellow, and blue.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Color Context</h2>
        <p>How colors behave in relation to other colors and shapes is a complex area of color theory. A single color might look different depending on its context and what it's being compared to. For instance, a midtone gray will appear lighter surrounded by dark colors but darker surrounded by bright colors.</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>Now that you have a basic understanding of color theory, you can begin to experiment with colors in your design projects. Remember, the rules of color theory are not rigid but intended as a guideline to help you understand and manipulate color effectively.</p>
