            <h1>How to Determine if a Hair Color Looks Good on You</h1>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>Choosing a new hair color can be exciting but also daunting. The right shade can transform your look, boost your confidence, and even make your features pop. Whether you're thinking about a subtle change or a radical transformation, here are some tips to help you decide whether a hair color will suit you.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Consider Your Skin Tone</h2>
            <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T202153.592.jpg" alt="Skin Tone Chart" width="500" height="300">
            <p>Your skin tone plays a crucial role in determining which hair color will look best on you. Skin tones are generally categorized into three types: cool, warm, and neutral. A simple way to determine your skin tone is to look at the veins in your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you likely have a cool skin tone; if they appear green, you have a warm skin tone; if it’s hard to tell, you probably have a neutral skin tone.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cool skin tones:</strong> Opt for hair colors like light ash blonde, ash brown, and shades like cool dark browns and jet black. Avoid gold, yellow, red, and bronze tones.</li>
                <li><strong>Warm skin tones:</strong> Look great with rich golden, caramel, copper, and honey tones. Avoid blue, violet, white, and jet black colors in your hair.</li>
                <li><strong>Neutral skin tones:</strong> Can wear almost any hair color. Both cool and warm colors mix well, so you have a variety of shades to choose from.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Eye Color</h2>
            <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T205858.174.jpg" alt="Eye Color Chart" width="500" height="300">
            <p>Your eye color can also be a good indicator of which hair colors might suit you. Hair colors that contrast the color of your eyes can make them stand out more, while colors that complement your eyes can create a harmonious and soft look.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blue eyes:</strong> Consider cool shades like ash blondes and cool browns which make blue eyes appear even bluer.</li>
                <li><strong>Brown eyes:</strong> Rich, warm colors like chestnuts and deep auburns often look stunning.</li>
                <li><strong>Green eyes:</strong> Tones of deep, warm red or light, cool blonde can enhance the green in your eyes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Natural Hair Color and Condition</h2>
            <img src="/images/colorGame/Snipaste_2024-05-14_21-24-51.png" alt="Natural Hair Color" width="500" height="300">
            <p>Another vital factor to consider is your natural hair color and its condition. Drastic changes can require heavy bleaching which might damage your hair if it’s not in good condition.</p>
            <p>Staying within two shades of your original hair color generally leads to more flattering results and minimal damage. However, if you're in for a drastic change, ensure to treat and prepare your hair for the process.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Maintenance and Commitment</h2>
            <p>Some hair colors require more maintenance than others. Before deciding on a hair color, consider how much time and money you are willing to spend on upkeep. Dark colors might need frequent touch-ups to cover gray hair or regrowth, while lighter colors may require regular conditioning treatments to prevent dryness and breakage.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Experiment with Temporary Solutions</h2>
            <p>If you're still wary about committing to a new hair color, temporary hair dyes or washes are a great way to test a new shade. These products allow you to see how a certain color looks on you with no long-term commitment, and they can be washed out with shampoo.</p>
        </section>

        <footer>
            <p>Choosing the right hair color is a blend of art and science. By considering all these factors, you're more likely to pick a color that not only looks stunning but also feels like the right match for your personality and style.</p>
