        </p>

        <h2>Highlights of the Game</h2>
        <p>The game witnessed Afghanistan piling up an enormous score of 278/3 in their allocated 20 overs. The Afghan openers, Hazratullah Zazai and Usman Ghani, set the stage with a breathtaking display of hitting. Zazai, well-known for his aggressive batting, smashed a splendid 162 not out off just 62 balls, including 16 sixes and 11 fours. This innings remains one of the highest individual scores in any T20 match. His strike partner, Ghani, supported well with a quick 73 off 48 balls.</p>

        <p>The duo forged a world record partnership for any wicket in T20 internationals, adding 236 runs for the first wicket. The Ireland bowlers were rendered virtually helpless in the face of such assault, as every attempt at stemming the runs seemed futile against the onslaught.</p>
        
        <p>The Irish side, despite being shell-shocked, did try to mount a respectable reply. Led by Paul Stirling who scored a valiant 91 off 50 balls and contributions from the middle order, Ireland managed to score 194/6. Yet, they fell short by 84 runs, making this encounter one of the most high-scoring matches ever in the format.</p>

        <p>This epic match not only showcased the hitting abilities of top international players but also set new benchmarks in T20 scoring. It emphasized how the T20 format has revolutionized cricket, pushing the boundaries of what is considered a par score.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Records</h2>
        <p>Afghanistan's staggering total of 278/3 became the highest-ever T20 international score by a team, surpassing the previous record of 263/3 set by Australia against Sri Lanka in 2016. Zazai's 162* is the highest individual score in T20 internationals, and the partnership he had with Ghani is the highest for any wicket in T20Is.</p>

        <p>The records set during this game underline the unpredictable and dynamic nature of T20 cricket and continue to be a significant talking point among cricket enthusiasts around the world. It is a vivid reminder of why T20 cricket attracts huge audiences and keeps the hearts of cricket fans racing.</p>
