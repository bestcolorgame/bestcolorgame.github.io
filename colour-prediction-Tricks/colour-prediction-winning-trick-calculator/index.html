            <h3>What is a Winning Trick Calculator?</h3>
            <p>A winning trick calculator is a tool designed to help players make more informed choices by analyzing past game results and using probabilistic theories to predict future outcomes. These tools often apply techniques from statistics and machine learning.</p>
            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>The calculator evaluates previous patterns of winning colours and calculates the probabilities of each color appearing in the next rounds. It considers various factors such as frequency, sequence, and time intervals between different colours appearing.</p>
