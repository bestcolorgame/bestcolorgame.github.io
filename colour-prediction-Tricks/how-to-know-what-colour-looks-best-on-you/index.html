    <h1>How to Determine What Colors Look Best on You</h1>
    <p>Finding the colors that complement your skin tone, eyes, and hair color can amplify your appearance, boosting your confidence and elevating your style. Here's a guide to help you determine the colors that look best on you.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Understand Your Skin's Undertone</h2>
        <img src="/images/colorGame/images - 2024-05-14T202205.973.jpg" alt="Examples of different skin undertones">
        <p>The first step in determining which colors flatter you the most is understanding your skin's undertone. Skin undertones are generally categorized into three types: warm, cool, and neutral.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm undertones</strong> - Skin has a golden, yellow, or peachy hue.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool undertones</strong> - Skin has hints of blue, pink, or a ruddy complexion.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral undertones</strong> - Skin does not have an obvious pink, olive, or sallow coloration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can determine your undertone by looking at the veins in your wrist. If they appear green, you likely have warm undertones. Veins that look blue or purple indicate cool undertones, while veins that are color indistinct suggest neutral undertones.</p>

        <h2>Choosing Colors That Complement Your Undertone</h2>

        <p>Once you know your undertone, you can move on to selecting colors that enhance your natural features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm undertones:</strong> Stick to earth tones like reds, oranges, yellows, and olive greens. These colors will emphasize the warmth of your skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool undertones:</strong> Choose colors like blue, lavender, rose, and grey which will complement your cooler features.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral undertones:</strong> You have more flexibility but typically look best in muted or 'dusty' versions of colors, such as jade green, dusty pink, and lagoon blue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consider Your Hair and Eye Color</h2>

        <p>Your hair and eye color can also strongly affect which shades look best on you. Here are some quick tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dark hair and light eyes:</strong> Contrasting colors like jade green or cobalt blue can be striking.</li>
            <li><strong>Light hair and dark eyes:</strong> Soft pastels like peach, lilac, and light blue can enhance your features subtly.</li>
            <li><strong>Red hair:</strong> Earthy tones like green, beige, and burnt orange can be very flattering.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Experiment and Learn</h2>
        <p>While these guidelines can provide a starting point, nothing beats personal experimentation. Try on different colors in natural lighting and see how they play against your skin, hair, and eyes. Notice how different colors make you feel and which ones draw the most compliments. Personal preference also plays a big role in selecting colors that you actually enjoy wearing.</p>
