    <h1>Predicting Your Baby's Eye Color</h1>
    <p>Curious about what color eyes your future offspring might have? While it’s a bit of genetic roulette, we can use science to make an educated guess. Eye color is primarily determined by the pigmentation of the iris and the way in which light scatters around the medium. Below, we'll explore how genetics influence eye color, the common patterns, and how to predict what shade might appear in your little one's eyes.</p>

    <h2>The Genetics of Eye Color</h2>
    <p>The color of the human eye is a trait mediated by more than one gene. Although the simplistic Mendelian genetics predicts eye color based on the alleles parents possess (dominant and recessive genes), the modern understanding includes multiple genes contributing to this trait.</p>

    <p>Primarily, two genes are significant predictors of eye color—OCA2 and HERC2, located on chromosome 15, which regulate melanin production in the iris. The pigmentation intensity of the iris is what leads to variations in eye color from blue to dark brown. More melanin equals darker eye shades.</p>
        
    <h3>Common Patterns in Genetics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Two Brown-Eyed Parents</strong> - Typically, if both parents have brown eyes, their children will also have brown eyes. Although rare, mutations or recessive genes can lead to non-brown eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue-Eyed Parents</strong> - If both parents have blue eyes, their children are very likely to also have blue eyes, as they might only carry recessive eye-color genetics.</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed Eye Color Parents</strong> - This can result in a variety of combinations, where any eye color could appear depending on numerous variables involved in dominant and recessive interactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using a Punnett Square to Predict Eye Color</h2>
    <p>A Punnett square can help predict the probability of an offspring having a particular eye color based on their parents' genotypes. Here's a basic example with one eye color gene, where B represents a brown eye allele and b a blue eye allele:</p>

    <h3>How to Do It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify the parents' genotypes (what genes they carry for eye color).</li>
        <li>Setup the Punnett square by placing each parent’s alleles along one axis each.</li>
        <li>Fill out the squares to see all possible genetic combinations.</li>
        <li>Review the resulting genotypes to consider the potential eye colors.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Beyond Genetics</h2>
    <p>Although genetics offer a substantial clue into the prospective eye color of a child, it's essential to recognize variability. Factors like mutations, the interaction of multiple genes, and even environmental influences can slightly modify these outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>While predicting your baby's eye color can never be done with absolute certainty, understanding genetics gives you a fascinating glimpse into the pathways that shape physical human traits. Whether your child has blue, brown, green, or hazel eyes, each shade brings its own unique beauty and mystery.</p>
