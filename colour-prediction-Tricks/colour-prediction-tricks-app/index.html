    <h2>Understanding the Basics of Colour Prediction</h2>
    <p>Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand how colour prediction games work. These games often feature a sequence of colours or a spinning wheel that randomly stops on a certain color. The objective for the player is to guess the outcome correctly. The randomness of these games can make them intriguing yet challenging.</p>

    <h2>Colour Prediction Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>Here are some generic strategies that might increase your chances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Gather data from past rounds and analyze it for any patterns or frequently appearing colours. This isn't foolproof, but trends can offer clues.</li>
        <li><strong>Probability Theory:</strong> Understanding basic probability can help you make more informed guesses. Calculating the odds of a particular outcome can guide your decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Limiting Bets:</strong> Stick to a betting strategy where you control your finances strictly. Increasing bets continuously can lead to significant losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Practicing:</strong> Some apps offer free versions of their games. Utilize these to practice without financial risk.</li>
    </ul>
