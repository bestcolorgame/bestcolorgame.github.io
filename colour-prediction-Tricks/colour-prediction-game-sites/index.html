            <h2>How Do These Games Work?</h2>
            <p>
                The typical colour prediction game operates on a random output generated by software algorithms. Players choose a color from a set (commonly two or three options like red, green, and violet) before a timer runs out. After bets are placed, the game reveals the color, and winners receive their winnings based on payout rates specific to the game.
