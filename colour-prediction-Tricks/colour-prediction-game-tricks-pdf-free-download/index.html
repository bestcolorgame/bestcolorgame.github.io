        <p>Welcome to the exciting world of colour prediction games where quick thinking and strategic planning can lead to great rewards! These games, popular in various online platforms, require players to predict the outcome of a colour change. While they may seem based purely on luck, there are strategies you can employ to enhance your chances of winning.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the tricks, it's crucial to understand the basic mechanics of colour prediction games. These games typically involve predicting the colour outcome of a spinning wheel or a similar randomized colour selection. Common colours include red, green, and violet, and the game might involve other variations and rules depending on the platform.</p>
        
        <h2>Top Tricks for Colour Prediction Games</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <h3>1. Study Patterns</h3>
