    <h1>Determining Your Eye Color</h1>
    <p>Understanding your eye color can be more than just an aesthetic interest; it can also provide insights into your genetic makeup and even impact how you choose to make up or wear certain colors. Here's how you can accurately determine your eye color.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Find Natural Light</h2>
    <p>Eye color can look different in artificial lighting, so to get an accurate assessment, you should examine your eyes in natural daylight. Stand near a window or outside on a bright day but out of direct sunlight, which can cause squinting or eye water.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Use a Mirror</h2>
    <p>Use a handheld mirror or stand in front of a bathroom mirror to get a clear view of your eyes. Ensure the light is sufficient so you can see the subtleties in the color of your irises.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Observe the Color of the Iris</h2>
    <p>The iris is the colored portion of your eye. Look closely at the color patterns in your iris. Are there flecks of gold? Ring patterns? Is it uniform? Eyes are not just simply blue or brown; many have specks or blends of different colors.</p>

    <h3>Common Eye Colors:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brown:</strong> Brown is the most common eye color worldwide. It can vary from light cedar to deep black-brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Blue eyes are generally clearer and can range from a faint ice-blue to a deep, nearly violet hue.</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Less common than blue or brown, green eyes are often remarked for their vivid quality and can also have patterns of brown or gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Hazel:</strong> Hazel eyes are a mixture of brown and green or brown and gold, often changing color depending on the light.</li>
        <li><strong>Grey:</strong> Grey eyes are rarer and can sometimes look blue or green depending on the environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 4: Confirm with Others</h2>
    <p>It might be helpful to ask friends or family what color they think your eyes are, as sometimes self-observation can be biased or unsure. They can provide an outsider’s perspective on the dominant color in your eyes.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Consider Lighting and Clothing</h2>
    <p>Remember, certain colors you wear can enhance different undertones in your eyes. For example, wearing a green shirt can make the green in hazel eyes pop, or a blue hat can highlight bluish tones in grey eyes.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Genetics Behind Eye Color</h2>
    <p>Eye color is primarily genetic, determined by the interaction of multiple genes. The pigment melanin affects how light or dark the eye color appears. People with less melanin have lighter eyes. This genetic trait is inherited, meaning your eye color is a blend of your parents' and even grandparents’ eye colors.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Determining your eye color can be a fun exploration into your personal attributes. Whether you're just curious or looking to update your look with new makeup or clothing colors that best enhance your eyes, understanding your true eye color is a great start!</p>
