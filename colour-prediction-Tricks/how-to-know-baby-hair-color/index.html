        <h1>What Determines a Baby's Hair Color?</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered about what determines the color of your baby’s hair? Understanding the genetics of hair color can give you insights into what to expect when your little one is born. Although predicting the exact shade is not always possible, genetics provide us with some clues.
        </p>

        <h2>The Genetics Behind Hair Color</h2>
        <p>
            Hair color is primarily determined by the type and amount of a pigment called melanin found in the hair. There are two main types of melanin: eumelanin (which is either black or brown, dictating the darkness of the hair) and pheomelanin (which determines the redness). The specific combination and concentration of these melanins in the hair follicles, influenced by various genes, determine the hair color of your baby.
        </p>

        <h2>What Does Genetics Say?</h2>
        <p>
            The MC1R gene plays a significant role in determining whether someone has red hair, and possibly the presence of other lighter hair colors such as blond and light brown. Other genes associated with hair color include TYR, OCA2, and ATRN, which influence the amount and types of melanin produced by the cells. However, more than one gene is involved in defining the hair color, and each of these genes has multiple variants.

        <h2>Can We Predict the Hair Color of a Baby?</h2>
        <p>
            Predicting the exact hair color of a newborn is challenging due to the interactions of multiple genes. While parents with similar hair colors are more likely to have children with like colors, there can always be variations. For instance, two brown-haired parents could have a child with blond or even red hair, depending on the hidden recessive genes that come into play.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes Over Time</h2>
        <p>
            It's also important to note that a baby’s hair color can change as they grow older. The color you see at birth can darken, lighten, or change over time due to aging, exposure to the sun, and other environmental factors. It is common for babies born with light hair to experience darkening of their hair color during their first few years of life.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            While we can make educated guesses based on genetics and observe trends in family traits, predicting a baby's hair color with certainty remains an exciting mystery of nature. The best approach is to wait and enjoy the surprise that comes with discovering all the traits of your new family member.
