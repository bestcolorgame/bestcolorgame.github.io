    <h2>Example Case Study</h2>
    <p>Consider a football match between Team A (home) and Team B (away). If the home team has a strong record, no significant injuries, and historical dominance over Team B, betting on a home win might be a wise choice. However, if Team B has recently boosted their squad and shown improvement, the odds for an away win or draw could offer better value.</p>
