    <h1>What Color Hair Will My Baby Have?</h1>

    <article>
        <p>Trying to guess your future baby's hair color is a fun and curious endeavor for expectant parents. While genetics play a key role, it can sometimes be surprising. In this article, we'll explore the factors that determine hair color, predict potential outcomes, and discuss genetic variations.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Genetics</h2>
        <p>Hair color is determined by the type and amount of melanin (pigment) in the hair. The type of melanin, which can be either eumelanin (black or brown) or pheomelanin (red), is influenced by genetic inheritance. The specific genes responsible for hair color are predominantly found on the MC1R gene, and parents pass these genes onto their children.</p>

        <h2>Genetic Probability</h2>
        <p>Both parents contribute one allele from each of their two hair color genes. The combination of these alleles will determine the hair color of their baby. For example, if both parents carry predominant alleles for dark hair, their baby will likely have dark hair. However, if one parent has a recessive allele for blond hair, and the other has a mixture, there's a chance for lighter hair. The chart below illustrates some of these probable combinations:</p>

        <h2>Phenotypic Expression of Genes</h2>
        <p>The phenotypic expression, or visible traits, of these genes can be influenced by other genetic factors. Some genes can override others, which can sometimes lead to unexpected hair colors that may differ significantly from the parents. Furthermore, the amount of melanin can change over time, which is why some babies born with blond hair might end up with brown hair as they grow older.</p>

        <h2>The Role of Ancestry</h2>
        <p>Ancestry also plays a crucial role in determining hair color. For example, genetic diversity in populations from Europe tends to be higher, which makes predicting hair color more complex due to the large mixture of potential genetic combinations. On the other hand, regions with less genetic diversity, like Asia, often have more predictability in hair color outcomes due to fewer dominant genes for hair color variation.</p>

        <h2>Can We Predict with Certainty?</h2>
        <p>While we can make educated guesses based on genetics and probability, predicting the exact hair color of a baby is not fully possible with current knowledge and technology. DNA testing can offer some clues, but even these tests cannot guarantee specific results due to the complex nature of genetics and gene expression.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, while you can estimate potential hair colors with some level of accuracy, the beauty of genetics is that it always has a way of surprising us. Each child is a unique blend of their genetic lineage, making them wonderfully unique.</p>
