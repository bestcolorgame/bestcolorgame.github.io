Levitation, or the flying trick, has long been a popular feat in magic, captivating audiences by seemingly defying the basic laws of gravity. Master magicians like David Copperfield have famously made the art of levitation appear both thrilling and mystical. Here's a detailed guide to understanding and performing basic levitation tricks that can be both entertaining and perplexing to your audience.

### The Balducci Levitation

This is perhaps the simplest form of levitation to execute, requiring no special equipment other than your own two feet and a bit of practice.

#### How It's Done:

1. **Positioning**: Have your audience stand at a 45-degree angle from you. This is crucial as it helps in obscuring their view of the trick.
   
2. **Execution**: Stand on the tips of your toes of one foot, while lifting the other foot off the ground. It’s important that the foot lifting off the ground is hidden from the audience's view by the foot you're balancing on.

3. **Performance**: Make sure to add dramatic effects. Raise your arms slowly as if you are harnessing mystical energies, and then gently lift your foot. The viewers from the correct angle will see you floating a few inches off the ground.

### The King Levitation

Another street levitation trick that makes it look like you're floating a few inches off the floor.

#### How It's Done:

1. **Setup**: Wear wide-flaring pants to hide your feet movements.
   
2. **Execution**: Lift yourself using the front of one foot, while keeping the other foot flat on the ground. This foot hides the action of the other foot which is giving you the lift.

3. **Performance**: Similar to the Balducci Levitation, the dramatic gestures and the mystery in your expressions will enhance the illusion.

### The Criss Angel Levitation

This one involves a bit more skill and can impress anyone if done correctly.

#### How It's Done:

1. **Preparation**: This trick may require custom shoes or gimmicks, where one shoe is attached to the back of the other. However, a basic form can still be performed with normal footwear.

2. **Execution**: Stand far enough from your audience so that they cannot see your feet closely. Use one foot to lift the other by the heel, concealing most of your lifting foot behind your standing leg.

3. **Angle**: It’s all about the angle and the distance. Practice the height you can achieve and the best angle for your audience to stand.

### Safety and Tips

- **Practice**: As with any physical performance, ensure that you practice these moves to avoid injury.
  
- **Angles are Crucial**: Always remember the viewer's point of view is what makes the trick believable. Practice in front of a mirror or record yourself to refine your act.
  
- **Narration**: A compelling story or explanation as to how you are managing to levitate can enhance the illusion and entertainment value.

- **Audience Management**: Make sure the audience stays where they can see the illusion intended. Manipulating their position subtly can be part of the trick.

This magical skill requires patience, practice, and creativity. Whether you're performing for friends, at a party, or on a street corner, these levitation tricks are sure to garner gasps and applause. Happy levitating!
