            <h2>Understanding the Basics: What is Parity?</h2>
            <p>
                In mathematics, parity refers to the attribute of an integer's inclusion in one of two categories: even or odd. An integer is even if it is divisible by two, and odd if it is not. This concept, although simple, forms the basis of the parity trick in predicting outcomes in various games and puzzles.

            <h2>How Does the Color Prediction Game Work?</h2>
            <p>
                The essence of the color prediction game lies in predicting the color of the hidden item based on previous color appearances and using the parity principle. Hereâ€™s a simple way to implement it:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Prepare multiple colored objects (like balls or cards) ensuring that they come in pairs of colors (for instance, 5 red and 5 blue).</li>
                <li><strong>Game Play:</strong> Without the guesser seeing, one colored object is hidden by another player. The remaining objects are displayed to the guesser.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The guesser then has to predict the color of the hidden object based on the colors they can see.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The trick to this game is using the parity of the visible objects to determine what is missing. If the visible number of red balls is even, then the hidden ball is red (since it will make the total odd), and vice versa for blue.

            <h2>Strategies to Excel at the Color Prediction Game</h2>
            <p>
                While the game might seem reliant on luck, understanding the concept of even and odd numbers and their distributions can significantly boost your chances:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay Attentive:</strong> Keep track of both color counts constantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Math:</strong> Practice quick calculations to swiftly decide the parity status of visible objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Your Tells:</strong> If you are hiding the object, be aware not to give away cues through your behavior or expressions.</li>
            </ul>
