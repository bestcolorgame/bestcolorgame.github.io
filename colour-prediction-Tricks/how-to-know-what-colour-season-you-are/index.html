        <h1>Discover Your Colour Season</h1>
        <p>Understanding your <strong>colour season</strong> can transform the way you shop for clothes and apply makeup, letting you choose shades that complement your natural tones. Below we’ll guide you through figuring out which colour season best matches your features.</p>
        
        <h2>What Are Colour Seasons?</h2>
        <p>Colour seasons are based on a theory that categorizes different skin tones, hair and eye colors into specific seasons—Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Each season is linked to a set of colors that harmonizes naturally with the characteristic hues of individuals within these categories.</p>

        <h2>Identifying Your Colour Season</h2>
        <p>Here's a simple step-by-step guide to identify your own colour season:</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Understand the Basics of Skin Undertone</h3>
        <p>Everyone’s skin has an undertone that is either cool, warm, or neutral. This is crucial in determining your colour season.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Your skin has pink, red or bluish undertones.</li>
            <li><strong>Warm:</strong> Your skin has yellow, peachy, golden, or olive undertones.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> A mix of both cool and warm undertones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Assess Your Natural Hair and Eye Color</h3>
        <p>People with cool undertones might usually have hair that is black, brown, blond with ashy streaks, and eyes that are blue, grey, or green. Warm-toned individuals often have golden blonde, flat black, brown-gold, carrot, or dirty grey hair, with brown, amber, or hazel eyes.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Match Your Colour Season</h3>
        <p>Once you know your undertone and your natural hair and eye color, you can find out your colour season:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Warm undertone with light to dark blonde or light to medium brown hair. Eyes might be blue, green, turquoise, or light brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Cool undertone with hair that may be naturally blonde or brunette with ashen streaks. Eyes often include blue, grey-blue, or green.</li>
            <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Warm undertone with rich earthy hair like red, auburn, or dark brown. Eyes are usually brown, hazel, or green.</li>
            <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Cool undertone with hair that could be black to ash brown. Bright, clear eyes that are blue, green, or deep brown.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applying Your Colour Season</h2>
        <p>Knowing your colour season can help you choose clothing, accessories, and makeup that enhance your natural beauty. Wearing the right colours can make your skin look more vibrant and healthier, whereas the wrong colors can make you look tired and washed out.</p>

        <p>For example, if you are a <strong>Winter</strong>, you might choose bold and rich colors such as navy blue, red, or charcoal grey. If you are a <strong>Spring</strong>, softer shades like peach, beige, or aqua can be more flattering.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Determining your colour season is not just about adhering to a set of rules—it's about enhancing your natural beauty and expressing your unique self with confidence. Experiment with the recommended colours and you'll likely discover a palette that makes you feel vibrant and alive.</p>
