            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Expecting parents often wonder about the features their baby will inherit. One of the most exciting aspects to anticipate is the color of the baby's hair. While it's all part of the genetic lottery, there are some fun and semi-scientific ways to predict the hair color of your future offspring.

                In this article, we'll delve into how genetics determine hair color, explore some common patterns, and introduce a basic baby hair color predictor tool to give you a glimpse into the possible hues of your baby’s locks.

            <h2>The Genetics of Hair Color</h2>
            <p>
                Hair color is primarily determined by the type and amount of melanin, a pigment present in the hair follicles. There are two main types of melanin: eumelanin (which determines darkness) and pheomelanin (which determines redness). The balance between these types of melanin, controlled by several genes, dictates the color of a person’s hair.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/colorGame/screen-4.jpg" alt="Genetic Structure of Hair Color">
            <p>
                The most influential genes in hair color are located on chromosome 16 (MC1R gene) and chromosome 15 (SLC45A2 gene). These genes influence how much melanin is produced and how it is distributed in the hair shaft. Variations in these genes can lead to different hair colors across the spectrum.

            <h2>Predicting Your Baby's Hair Color</h2>
            <h3>Common Genetic Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                Generally, darker hair colors tend to dominate over lighter colors. For example, if one parent has black hair and the other blonde, the child is more likely to have dark hair. However, it’s not always straightforward as recessive genes can sometimes express themselves, leading to unexpected hair colors.

            <h3>Using a Baby Hair Color Predictor</h3>
            <p>
                Several online tools use basic genetic principles to predict your baby's hair color. These tools typically ask for the hair color of the baby’s parents and sometimes grandparents, before giving a percentage chance of various hair colors.
            </p>
            <p>
                While interesting and fun, it’s important to remember that these predictors are not 100% accurate. They do not account for all genetic variations and complexities involved in heredity.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Predicting your baby's hair color can be a fun activity for expecting parents, but it's important to take these predictions with a grain of salt. Genetics is a complex field, and many other genes can influence the outcome beyond the basic models used in online predictors.

                No matter the hair color, your baby will be unique in their own way. Embrace the surprise element and whatever wonderful features your baby inherits!
