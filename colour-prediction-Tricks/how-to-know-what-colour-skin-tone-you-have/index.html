    <h1>How to Determine Your Skin Tone</h1>
    <p>Understanding your skin tone is essential for choosing the right makeup, hair color, and clothing to complement your natural beauty. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to identify your skin tone and suggest ways to enhance your features.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Understand the Basics</h2>
    <p>Skin tone is often confused with skin color, but they are not the same. Skin color is the surface color that can change due to various factors like sun exposure or health conditions. Skin tone, however, refers to the undertone of your skin that remains constant.</p>
    <p>There are generally three categories of skin tone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Pink, red, or bluish undertones.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm:</strong> Yellow, peachy, golden undertones.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> A mix of both cool and warm undertones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: The Wrist Test</h2>
    <p>One of the simplest ways to determine your skin tone is by looking at the veins in your wrist under natural sunlight.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If your veins appear <strong>blue or purple</strong>, you likely have a cool skin tone.</li>
        <li>If your veins look <strong>green</strong>, you probably have a warm skin tone.</li>
        <li>If it’s difficult to discern the color and seems to be a mix of blue, green, or purple, you might have a neutral skin tone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: The Sun Reaction Test</h2>
    <p>How your skin reacts to the sun can also help indicate your skin tone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cool-toned</strong> skin tends to burn quickly compared to tanning.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm-toned</strong> skin usually tans easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral-toned</strong> skin might burn but also tan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 4: The Jewelry Test</h2>
    <p>Another way to figure out your skin tone is to see which type of jewelry complements you better:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Silver jewelry typically suits those with <strong>cool</strong> tones.</li>
        <li>Gold jewelry looks best on those with <strong>warm</strong> tones.</li>
        <li>If both metals look good, you likely have a <strong>neutral</strong> skin tone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 5: The Color Test</h2>
    <p>Consider which colors in clothing make your skin, eyes, and hair pop:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cool tones</strong> are enhanced by blue, purple, and emerald green.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm tones</strong> look great in red, peach, coral, and gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral tones</strong> can wear colors from both cool and warm spectrums, but they look particularly good in muted shades.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Determining your skin tone can take a bit of experimentation, but it’s worth the effort. Once you understand which category you fall into, you can make more informed decisions about fashion, beauty, and hair color that will best suit you. Remember, regardless of the tests, wear what makes you feel confident and beautiful!</p>
