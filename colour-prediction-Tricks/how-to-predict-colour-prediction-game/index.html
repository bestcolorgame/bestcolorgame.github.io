        <h2>1. Understand the Basics of Color Theory</h2>
        <p>Learning about the color wheel and how colors relate to one another can give you insights into possible patterns, especially in games where the color transition follows logical sequences. Knowing complementary colors, analogous colors, and triads can be incredibly useful.</p>

        <h2>2. Look for Patterns</h2>
        <p>Most color prediction games are built around patterns. It may be random, but there is usually some form of pattern or rule governing the sequence of colors. Try to observe and detect recurring sequences or any regularities that can clue you into the upcoming colors.</p>

        <h2>4. Use Statistical Techniques</h2>

        <h2>5. Stay Patient and Keep a Record</h2>
