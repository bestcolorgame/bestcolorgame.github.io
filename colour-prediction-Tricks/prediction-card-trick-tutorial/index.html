            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to the Prediction Card Trick</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare your prediction:</strong> Before you start the trick, write down a prediction on the piece of paper. For instance, "The Queen of Hearts." Place this prediction in an envelope or fold it and keep it visible to all but do not reveal what it is just yet.</li>

                <li><strong>Shuffle the deck:</strong> In front of your audience, thoroughly shuffle the deck of cards. You can allow a spectator to shuffle them as well to show that there are no tricks with the deck itself.</li>

                <li><strong>Select a card:</strong> Fan out the cards face down and let a spectator select any card. Emphasize that they can pick any card they feel drawn to.</li>

                <li><strong>Reveal the prediction:</strong> Once the spectator has selected the card, allow them to place their card face down on the table without revealing it to anyone, including you. Then dramatically reveal your written prediction and ask the spectator to reveal the card they chose.</li>
