        <h1>Discover Your Personal Color Palette</h1>
        <p>Understanding your personal color palette can enhance your wardrobe, make shopping easier, and boost your confidence by always knowing which colors look best on you. This guide will help you determine which colors are your true match based on your skin tone, eye color, and hair color.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1: Understanding Color Theory</strong></p>
        <p>Before diving into personal colors, itâ€™s crucial to have a basic understanding of color theory. The color wheel, a fundamental tool in selecting harmonious colors, is divided into primary colors (red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (orange, green, violet), and tertiary colors (mix of primary and secondary colors).</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Determine Your Skin Undertone</strong></p>
        <p>Your skin undertone is the underlying color tone of your skin. There are three main undertones: Cool (pink, red or bluish undertones), Warm (yellow, peachy, golden undertones), and Neutral (a mix of warm and cool undertones).</p>
        <p>To determine your undertone, look at the veins in your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you likely have a cool undertone. Green veins indicate a warm undertone, while blue-green veins suggest a neutral undertone.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Analyze Your Natural Colors</strong></p>
        <p>Your natural colors extend beyond your skin to include your hair and eye color. Generally, people with cool undertones have eyes that are blue, grey, or green and have hair that has silver, ash, or black tones. Those with warm undertones often have brown, amber, or hazel eyes with strawberry blonde, red, brown, or black hair that has gold, red, orange, or yellow tones. People with neutral undertones may have any hair or eye color.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Experiment with Colors</strong></p>
        <p>After identifying your undertone and natural colors, experiment with different colors within these ranges. People with cool undertones look good in blues, purples, emerald greens, and frosty shades of lavender, ice blue, or pink. Warm undertones shine in rich shades like amber, gold, orange, and warm reds and greens. Neutral tones can wear colors from both the warm and cool spectrum, but they often look best in softened or muted versions of a color.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5: Consider Your Contrast Levels</strong></p>
        <p>Contrast level between your skin and hair color can also guide your color palette choices. A high contrast, typically seen in individuals with dark hair and light skin, calls for bold, contrasting colors. Low contrast, on the other hand, can be complemented with soft, blended hues.</p>

        <p>With these insights, you're well-equipped to explore and embrace the colors that make you look and feel your best. Remember, the key is to experiment and have fun with your color palette!</p>
