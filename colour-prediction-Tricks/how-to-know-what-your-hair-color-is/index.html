    <h1>Discover Your Hair Color: A Guide to Understanding Your Natural Shade</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wondered exactly what your natural hair color is? Whether you're looking to describe your hair shade accurately or considering a new hair dye that complements your natural tone, understanding your hair color is a great place to start. This guide will help you identify and appreciate the unique color of your hair.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Assessing Your Hair in Natural Light</h2>
        <p>The first step in determining your hair color is to examine it under natural light. Artificial lighting can alter how colors appear, so it's important to view your hair in conditions that provide the most accurate reflection of its true color.</p>

        <p>To do this, stand outside on a sunny day or by a window with natural daylight. Bring a mirror with you or ask a friend to help you see your hair in the light. You can even take a high-quality photo or video to review later.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Understanding Hair Color Spectrum</h2>
        <p>Your natural hair color can be broadly classified into the following categories: blonde, red, brown, and black. These main types can be broken down further into specific shades based on the tone and depth of your hair color.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blonde:</strong> Ranges from pale platinum to dark blonde.</li>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Includes vivid copper tones to deep burgundy.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown:</strong> Encompasses light brown to nearly black.</li>
            <li><strong>Black:</strong> Ranges from soft black to jet black, often with hints of blue or brown.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Distinguishing Undertones</h2>
        <p>Aside from the primary color, your hair’s undertone plays a crucial role in defining its full spectrum. Undertones can be warm, cool, or neutral:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warm:</strong> Look for hints of yellow, orange, or red.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Look for hints of blue, green, or violet.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> A balance between warm and cool tones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examining your hair closely in natural light will help you spot these subtle undertones. This is especially important if you are planning to dye your hair, as selecting a color that complements your undertone can lead to more natural-looking results.</p>

        <h2>Using Technology as a Tool</h2>
        <p>If you’re struggling to determine your hair color and undertone, consider using a hair color app or online tool. These technologies can provide instant feedback and even suggest hair colors for you to try. Make sure to use these tools in good lighting to enhance accuracy.</p>
