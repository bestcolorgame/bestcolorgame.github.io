    <h2>Parking Pro Tips</h2>
    <p>Parking can be daunting at Doris Mall, especially during peak hours and holidays. Opt for rooftop parking if available—it often has more spaces. Additionally, noting the color or number of the nearest exit to your parking spot can save you from wandering around searching for your car later.</p>
    
    <h2>Loyalty Programs</h2>
    <p>Many stores in Doris Mall offer loyalty programs that can provide you with exclusive discounts, rewards, and access to special events. Signing up for these can enhance your shopping experience and save money in the long run.</p>

    <h2>Safety Measures</h2>
    <p>Given today’s health considerations, always adhere to safety protocols in place. Use hand sanitizers provided at many points across the mall, wear masks as required, and maintain social distancing to ensure your safety and that of others.</p>
    
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>Finally, if you have suggestions or need assistance, don’t hesitate to contact the mall's customer service. Your feedback helps improve the services provided and enhance the overall shopping experience.</p>
    
    <p>Equipped with these tips and prepared for a variety of shopping situations, your visit to Doris Mall will not only be enjoyable but also efficient. Remember that the goal is to have a pleasant experience while finding everything you need.</p>
