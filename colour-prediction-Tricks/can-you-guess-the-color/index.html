        <h2>Introduction to Color Psychology</h2>
        <p>Color psychology is the study of hues as a determinant of human behavior. Colors can influence perceptions that are not obvious, such as the taste of food, the setting of a mood, or the likelihood of a behavior occurring. It is a vital field of study that impacts marketing, interior design, art, and several other areas aimed at human activity.</p>

        <p>Colors can have a profound impact on one's emotions and behaviors. For instance, blue is often seen as calming and serene, making it popular for bedrooms and hospitals. On the other hand, red can increase energy levels and is frequently used in places that want to evoke excitement, like sports facilities and casinos.</p>
