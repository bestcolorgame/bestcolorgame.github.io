        <h1>The "Guess the Number" Trick Explained</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to the Trick</h2>
        <p>
            The "Guess the Number" trick is a classic mind game that amazes and entertains audiences, both young and old. It involves the magician guessing a number that the participant has secretly chosen, using seemingly mystical powers. However, like all great magic, it’s grounded in clever methodology and psychological tricks rather than supernatural abilities.

        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Performing the Trick</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>1. Setup</h3>
            <p>
                Begin by getting a deck of cards or any set of numbered items. Ask your audience for a volunteer and make sure they feel comfortable and engaged.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Select a Number</h3>
            <p>
                Ask the participant to pick a number between 1 and 10 (or any range you feel comfortable with). It’s important to request that they keep this number secret and memorized.
            </p>

            <h3>3. The 'Magic' Computation</h3>
            <p>
                Tell your audience that through a series of calculations, you will determine their number. Ask them to multiply their number by 2, add 8 to the new number, multiply the result by 5, then subtract the original number. When they have their final number, ask them to reveal it to you.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Reveal the Number</h3>
            <p>
                Take the number they provide and perform some quick arithmetic. Subtract 40 and then divide the result by 10. The number you get is the original number they thought of.
            </p>

        <h2>Why the Trick Works</h2>
        <p>
            This trick works due to the specific operations involved. Each step is designed to return to a predictable number that can easily be reversed by the performer. By controlling the calculations, the performer ensures they can always backtrack to the original number regardless of what it was.
        </p>

        <h2>Tips for Performance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Practice your calculations:</strong> Make sure you can quickly and discreetly handle the math involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage with your audience:</strong> Build a narrative around your trick to make it more than just a number reveal.</li>
            <li><strong>Use misdirection:</strong> While they are focussing on their calculations, you can enhance the trick with clever banter or other magical elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Be confident:</strong> Your confidence can convince the audience of your 'magical' powers.</li>
        </ul>
