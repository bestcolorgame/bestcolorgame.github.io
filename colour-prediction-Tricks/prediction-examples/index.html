            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As urban areas continue to grow, the need for accessible green spaces has become more crucial than ever.

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Urban green spaces are vital for environmental health. They help in reducing urban heat, managing rainwater, and improving air quality. Large trees and vegetated areas absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, making the air cleaner and fresher. These areas also serve as habitats for various species, promoting biodiversity in urban settings.</p>

Cities that prioritize greenery can improve the quality of life for their residents and create more sustainable urban environments. Planning should integrate green spaces with urban architecture, providing easy accessibility and encouraging their daily use among city dwellers.</p>
