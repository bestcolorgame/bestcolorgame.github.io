    <h1>Determining Your Hair Color</h1>
    <p>Understanding your natural hair color can be helpful for many reasons, including choosing the right hair dye, knowing which makeup hues suit you best, or even satisfying simple curiosity. Below, we explore various methods to determine your natural hair color accurately.</p>

    <h2>1. Natural Light Observation</h2>
    <p>The simplest way to determine your hair color is by examining it under natural light. Artificial lighting can distort colors, so it's important to step outside on a bright day or stand by a window. Use a handheld mirror to view your hair or ask a friend to help you identify the colors in your hair.</p>

    <h2>2. Compare with a Hair Color Chart</h2>
    <p>Hair color charts can be a useful tool. These charts are often used in salons but are also available online. They feature a wide range of colors from black, brunette shades, to blondes and reds. By comparing your hair to the chart in natural light, you can pinpoint your color more accurately.</p>

    <h2>3. Consult a Professional</h2>
    <p>For a more accurate assessment, consider consulting a hair professional. Hairstylists and colorists are trained to identify subtle nuances in hair color and can provide insights based on their expertise. Visiting a salon could also provide you with more information on how to care for your hair color.</p>

    <h2>4. Genetics and Family Traits</h2>
    <p>Looking at your family can also offer clues about your hair color. Genetics play a significant role in determining hair color, so examining the hair colors of your immediate family members might give you a clearer idea of what your official shade might be.</p>

    <h2>5. Use Technology</h2>
