    <h1>Determining Your Eye Color</h1>
    <p>
        Understanding your eye color can enrich your knowledge about your genetics and give you insights into your ancestry. Here's a detailed guideline on how to determine the color of your eyes, along with explanations of what might cause particular eye color variations.
    </p>
    <h2>The Basics of Eye Color</h2>
    <p>
        Eye color is determined by the pigmentation of the iris, which surrounds the pupil of the eye. The primary pigment in the eye is melanin, which also determines hair and skin color. The amount and type of melanin, distributed in the iris, determine what color the eyes will appear.

    <h2>Steps to Identify Your Eye Color</h2>
    <p>
        Here are the steps you can take at home to determine what color your eyes are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Find a well-lit area:</strong> Natural daylight is the best lighting condition to identify true eye color.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a mirror:</strong> Stand in front of a mirror and look directly into it, positioning yourself so that light falls directly onto your face without causing glare.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring a reference chart:</strong> Have a reference chart available that shows a variety of eye colors. You can find these online or in some medical texts.</li>
        <li><strong>Examine your irises:</strong> Look at the color of the iris, not the pupil. Note if your eyes are a solid color, or if they have multiple tones.</li>
        <li><strong>Compare:</strong> Compare your iris color with the chart to see which category it best fits into. Common colors include blue, gray, green, hazel, and brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Factors Influencing Eye Color</h2>
    <p>
        While genetics play the primary role in determining eye color, there are other factors that can influence changes or variations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Your parents' genes determine your eye color. This genetic influence is complex, involving multiple genes inherited from both parents.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> It's common for babies to change eye colors during the first few years of life, as melanin production in the irises changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Perception of eye color can change based on the type and amount of light, as well as the environment a person is in.</li>
        <li><strong>Health conditions:</strong> Certain diseases and medications can change the color or appearance of your irises.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Common Variations in Eye Color</h2>
    <p>
        Here are some common types of eye color variations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hazel Eyes:</strong> A mix of green and brown, often containing flecks of both colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Amber Eyes:</strong> A solid golden or copper color that is uncommon in humans.</li>
        <li><strong>Gray Eyes:</strong> Less common than blue eyes, gray eyes are also affected by the amount of melanin and limbal ring size.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Determining your eye color can be a fun and insightful process. If you're interested in learning more about how genetics influence eye color or if your eye color changes, consider speaking to a geneticist or an ophthalmologist.
