    <h2>1. Wear White</h2>
    <p>Starting the race in a white shirt or costume will help you display all the colors thrown during the race. Most color runs provide participants with a white race shirt, known for catching color the best, ensuring that those vibrant powders pop in your race day photos!</p>

    <h2>2. Protect Your Eyes and Mouth</h2>
    <p>While the color powder used is generally non-toxic and safe, it’s still a good idea to wear sunglasses and a bandana or mask to cover your mouth. This will help prevent the powder from getting into your eyes and mouth, making your run more comfortable.</p>

    <h2>3. Prepare for a Mess</h2>
    <p>Color runs are inherently messy, and that’s part of the fun! Be prepared by bringing some towels for your car seats, a change of clothes, and a bag for your dirty items. Many races also have air blow stations at the finish line where you can dust off some of the excess powder before you head home.</p>

    <h2>4. Run with Friends and Family</h2>
    <p>Everything is better when you share it with friends and family! Form a team to enjoy the color run; not only will you motivate each other, but you’ll also make vibrant memories together. Plus, team photos with everyone covered in different colors make for great keepsakes.</p>

    <h2>5. Capture the Moment</h2>
    <p>Don't forget to bring your phone or camera—preferably in a protective cover or bag. Color runs are filled with photogenic moments that you’ll want to capture. Many events also offer photo stations with themed backdrops for that perfect post-race snapshot.</p>

    <h2>6. Pace Yourself</h2>
    <p>Remember, a color run is all about fun and enjoying the moment—not just racing to the finish line. It’s perfectly fine to walk, dance, or skip your way through the course. Enjoy every color station and the festive atmosphere!</p>

    <h2>7. Check the Weather</h2>
    <p>Weather can play a big role in your race day experience. Check the forecast and dress appropriately. If it’s going to be sunny, consider applying sunscreen. If a chilly day is expected, layer your clothes—but keep in mind they will get colored!</p>
