        <img src="/images/colorGame/Benefits-of-Color-Prediction-App-Development--1024x701.jpg" alt="Variety of hair colors" style="width:100%">
        <p>Hair color is one of the most noticeable features in humans and varies extensively around the world. From the deep blacks commonly seen in Asia to the wide range of browns and blondes in Europe, the diversity is striking. But what determines these vast differences in hair color? The answer lies in our genes.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>The Role of Melanin</h2>
        <p>Hair color is primarily determined by the type and amount of melanin, a pigment found in the hair follicles. There are two main types of melanin: eumelanin (responsible for black and brown hues) and pheomelanin (responsible for red hues). The ratio of these melanins and their concentration influence the specific color of a person's hair.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Genetic Factors</h2>
        <img src="/images/colorGame/images (15).png" alt="Genetic map of hair color genes" style="width:100%">
        <p>The genetics behind hair color are complex and influenced by multiple genes. The most well-known gene associated with hair color is the MC1R gene. Variations in the MC1R gene can lead to a wide range of hair colors and can also affect how much pheomelanin and eumelanin is produced by the melanocytes in hair follicles.</p>
        <p>Beyond MC1R, other genes such as TYR, OCA2, TRP1, and SLC24A4 also play significant roles in the pigmenting process. These genes influence the production of melanin and its distribution, leading to the wide variety of hair colors found among different individuals.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Environmental and Hormonal Influences</h2>
        <p>While genetics lay the foundation for hair color, environmental factors and changes in hormones can influence hair color throughout a personâ€™s life. Sun exposure, for instance, can lighten hair color by breaking down melanin, leading to lighter shades over time. Hormonal changes, particularly during puberty or pregnancy, can also cause changes in hair color and texture.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Ethnic and Geographic Variations</h2>
        <p>Different populations have distinct hair color distributions due to genetic diversity and evolutionary factors. For example, high concentrations of lighter hair colors are found in Northern and Eastern Europe, partially due to specific genetic variations that have higher frequency in these areas. These patterns of hair color distribution provide insights into historical migration and genetic evolution.</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
        <p>Understanding the genetics behind hair color not only satisfies curiosity but also enhances our knowledge of human biology and the complex interplay of genes and the environment. As research progresses, we may discover even more about how our genes influence one of our most visible traits.</p>
