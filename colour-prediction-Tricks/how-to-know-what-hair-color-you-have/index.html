    <h1>Determining Your Hair Color</h1>
    <p>Understanding your natural hair color can help you make informed decisions about dyeing your hair, choosing makeup, and picking clothing colors that best suit your look. Whether you're curious about your exact shade or looking to describe your hair color to professionals, here are step-by-step guidelines to help you identify your hair color accurately.</p>

    <h2>Steps to Determine Your Hair Color</h2>

    <h3>1. Find Natural Light</h3>
    <p>The first step in determining your hair color is to view your hair under natural lighting. Artificial lighting can distort colors, so it’s best to examine your hair outside on a sunny day or near a window with plenty of natural light.</p>

    <h3>2. Look at the Roots</h3>
    <p>Unless you have dyed your hair, the roots are often the most natural part of your hair color. Examine the color of the new growth to understand your true color. This can be particularly helpful for those who have hair that lightens or changes color with sun exposure.</p>

    <h3>3. Use a Color Chart</h3>
    <p>Professional salons often use hair color charts to match or choose hair dye. You can find these charts online to compare your hair color against the samples. This is a great way to get a more precise about your hair's color and undertone (e.g., ash, golden, neutral).</p>

    <h3>4. Consider Undertones</h3>
    <p>Just like skin, hair has undertones that can be warm, cool, or neutral. Cool undertones in hair can appear ashen or have hints of blue, green, or violet. Warm undertones might look golden, red, orange, or yellow. Neutral undertones are a mix of these colors. Understanding these can help you maintain or change your hair color more effectively.</p>

    <h3>5. Consult a Professional</h3>
    <p>If you’re still unsure about your hair color, consider consulting with a hair stylist. They have extensive experience and can provide professional insight into your hair's exact shade and what colors could complement it.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Different Hair Colors</h2>
    <p>Hair colors are generally categorized into four basic shades: black, brown, blonde, and red. There are numerous sub-shades and special cases like white or grey (which normally indicate natural aging or albinism). Each category is influenced by various factors, including genetics and environment.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Determining your hair color can be a fun and enlightening process. Whether you're doing it out of curiosity, for a new hair dye, or to update your style, the above steps will help you understand and appreciate the natural beauty of your hair.</p>
