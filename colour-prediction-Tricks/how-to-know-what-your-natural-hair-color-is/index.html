Understanding your natural hair color can be beneficial for various reasons, including getting insights into your personal style, choosing the right hair products, and even learning more about your genetic makeup.

There are two main types of melanin: eumelanin (responsible for dark pigments) and pheomelanin (responsible for lighter pigments). The combination and concentration of these melanins dictate your hair's hue.</p>`
