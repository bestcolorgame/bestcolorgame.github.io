            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The prediction card trick is a staple in the toolbox of both amateur and professional magicians. It involves the magician predicting a card that a participant will choose. Let's dive into one of the simplest yet impressive versions of this trick — and reveal how it’s done!

            <h2>How the Trick Appears</h2>
            <p>
                The magician presents a deck of cards and asks a spectator to shuffle them. After the shuffle, the magician claims they have already predicted the outcome earlier. They then display a sealed envelope marked "Prediction" that has been visible since the beginning of the performance. The spectator selects a card, and the magician opens the envelope, revealing a card inside that matches exactly.

            <h2>How It's Done</h2>
            <p>
               Believe it or not, the trick’s success largely hinges on the setup before the performance. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the method:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Preparation:</strong> The magician secretly puts a duplicate of the card they intend to 'predict' into an envelope. This envelope is then sealed and laid out in full view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Forcing a Card:</strong> During the trick, the magician uses a technique called 'card forcing' to ensure that the spectator picks the exact duplicate of the card in the envelope. There are many methods to force a card, such as the 'slip cut' or 'riffle force'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Revelation:</strong> Once the spectator selects the card the magician made them choose, the magician reveals the prediction in the envelope matches perfectly. This leaves the audience amazed by the accurate prediction.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Learning Points</h2>
            <p>
                While the trick might seem simple, successful execution requires practice, especially mastering card-forcing techniques without making the audience suspicious. It also shows the importance of presentation and timing in performing magic tricks effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're a budding magician, start by practicing your card forcing method until it’s seamless. Remember, the secret to magic is not just in making an illusion work but making sure that the audience feels involved and entertained throughout your performance.
