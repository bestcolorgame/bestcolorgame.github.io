        <h2>Genetic Factors</h2>
        <p>The primary determinant of the color of an individual's hair is their genetic makeup. Hair color is primarily influenced by the type and amount of pigments produced by cells known as melanocytes. These pigments are eumelanin (which can be black or brown) and pheomelanin (which is red). The balance and interaction between these two types of melanin determine the spectrum of hair color from black to blonde through browns and reds.</p>

        <h2>Role of Specific Genes</h2>
        <p>Several genes are involved in determining hair color, but the most significant are MC1R, which is responsible for the redhead phenotype, and a variety of other genes that regulate the melanin pigments, such as TYR, OCA2, and HERC2 genes. Variations or mutations in these genes can lead to different hair colors within the same family.</p>

        <h2>Environmental Influence</h2>
        <p>While genetics play a crucial role, environmental factors can also affect hair color. Prolonged exposure to the sun can lighten hair color, as the UV rays can gradually break down the melanin in the hair. Nutritional factors can also influence melanin production. For example, a deficiency in certain vitamins and minerals like Vitamin D, B12 and copper can impact hair pigment.</p>

        <h2>Age-Related Changes</h2>
        <p>As individuals age, they often experience changes in hair color, including graying. This change is due to the decrease in melanin production over time. The hair follicle loses pigment cells, leading to the growth of gray or white hair. This is an entirely natural process typically tied to genetics but can be influenced by health and environmental factors.</p>
