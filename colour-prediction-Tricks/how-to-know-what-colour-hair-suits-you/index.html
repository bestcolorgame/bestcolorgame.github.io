    <h1>How to Choose the Best Hair Color for You</h1>
    <p>Choosing the right hair color can enhance your appearance by complementing your skin tone, eye color, and personal style. Here's a guide to help you find the perfect hair color that suits you best.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Consider Your Skin Tone</h2>
    <p>The color of your skin plays a crucial role in determining which hair color will look best on you. Generally, skin tones can be divided into three categories: cool, warm, and neutral.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cool skin tones</b> have pink, red or blue undertones. Hair colors that tend to look great include shades of blonde, black, and cool browns.</li>
        <li><b>Warm skin tones</b> feature yellow, peachy, or golden undertones. Warm-toned people often look best with colors like golden blonde, auburn, and chestnut brown.</li>
        <li><b>Neutral skin tones</b> have a mix of warm and cool undertones, or may not have any dominant undertones at all. Most hair colors will complement a neutral skin tone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Evaluate Your Eye Color</h2>
    <p>Your eye color can also guide you in selecting the right hair shade. Certain hair colors can make your eye color pop and enhance their natural beauty.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Blue eyes:</b> Look stunning with cool blonde shades or ash browns that contrast nicely with the blue.</li>
        <li><b>Brown eyes:</b> Rich, deep colors like chocolate browns or vibrant burgundy emphasize their warmth.</li>
        <li><b>Green eyes:</b> Shades of red and auburn can highlight their vibrant green hue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Real-Life Testing</h2>
    <p>Before committing to a new hair color, it might be helpful to test how the shade looks with your complexion. This can be done through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Temporary wash-in colors:</b> These products can give you an idea of what a certain color might look like with your skin tone, without the long-term commitment.</li>
        <li><b>Consulting with a professional:</b> A hairstylist can offer professional advice and color swatches that help you visualize various shades on you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Personal Style and Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Your personal style should also influence your hair color choice. Opt for colors that you feel confident in and are excited about. Also, consider the upkeep required for certain hair colors. For example, vibrant colors like reds and pastels might require frequent salon visits to maintain their brightness.</p>

    <p>There are several apps and online tools available today that allow you to virtually try different hair colors on your photos. This can be a fun and easy way to see which colors suit you best without any risk.</p>
