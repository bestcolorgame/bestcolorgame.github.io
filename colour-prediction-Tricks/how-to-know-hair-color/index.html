    <h1>Understanding Hair Color: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Figuring out your hair color isn’t always as straightforward as it might seem. Whether you’re trying to understand your natural hair shade, choosing a new color, or curious about how hair coloring works, this guide will help you gain deep insights into the broad spectrum of hair colors.</p>

    <h2>Natural Hair Color</h2>
    <p>Human hair color is primarily determined by the type and amount of melanin in the hair. The two main types of melanin include eumelanin (responsible for black and brown shades) and pheomelanin (responsible for yellow and red shades). The absence or lesser amount of both types results in grey or white hair.</p>
    <p>To determine your natural hair color, consider these tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Look at natural light:</strong> Observe your hair in natural light as artificial lighting can alter how your hair color looks.</li>
        <li><strong>Consult a professional:</strong> A hairstylist can help you accurately determine your hair color and suggest colors that could naturally suit your complexion and personal style.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choosing a Hair Color</h2>
    <p>When choosing a new hair color, consider your skin tone, eye color, and natural hair color. These factors can help you decide a suitable shade that enhances your natural beauty.</p>

    <p>Here are some guidelines based on skin tone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Warm skin tones:</strong> Look better with golden, red, or darker hues.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool skin tones:</strong> Suit well with ash blonde, light blonde, or jet black hair colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral skin tones:</strong> Have the flexibility to wear almost any color.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hair Coloring Techniques</h2>
    <p>There are various techniques through which hair can be colored or bleached to achieve the desired shade:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All-over color:</strong> Single process coloring that changes the shade of your hair completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Involves lightening sections of hair to add dimension.</li>
        <li><strong>Balayage:</strong> A freehand technique where color is swept through small triangular sections of the hair to give a sun-kissed look.</li>
        <li><strong>Ombre:</strong> Hair color is gradually blended from one color hue to another, usually moving tints and shades from light to dark.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maintaining Your Hair Color</h2>
    <p>After coloring your hair, it’s essential to maintain its health and vibrancy with the right care:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use color-safe shampoos and conditioners:</strong> These products help to lock in moisture and color.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid frequent washes:</strong> Washing your hair too often can strip away the color and natural oils.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect from heat and sunlight:</strong> Use heat protectant sprays and hats to shield your hair from sun and heat damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This guide should assist you in navigating through various aspects of hair color and help you make informed decisions about your hair care and styling. Always remember, the best way to ensure perfect results is to consult with a professional hair stylist.</p>
