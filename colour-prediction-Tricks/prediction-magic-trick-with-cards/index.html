            <h2>Understanding the Basics of a Prediction Card Trick</h2>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Performing Your First Prediction Trick</h2>
            <p><strong>What You'll Need:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A standard deck of 52 cards</li>
                <li>A small piece of paper</li>
                <li>A pen</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Before your performance, remove a card from the deck—let's say the Queen of Hearts—and write its name on the piece of paper.</li>
                <li>Fold the paper and keep it in your pocket or another secret location easily accessible during the trick.</li>
                <li>Shuffle the rest of the deck thoroughly while making sure the Queen of Hearts remains hidden or in your control.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Invite a volunteer from your audience and present the shuffled deck for them to draw a card.</li>
                <li>While they draw a card, discreetly slip the Queen of Hearts on top of the deck, making it appear as if that was their chosen card.</li>
                <li>Ask the volunteer to place the card on top of the deck, shuffle the deck themselves, and then hand it back to you.</li>
                <li>Perform a few false shuffles that maintain the Queen of Hearts on top. If you're skilled in sleight of hand, use techniques like an overhand shuffle or a riffle shuffle.</li>
                <li>Spread the deck out face down and reveal the top card confidently as the Queen of Hearts, then show your written prediction for an added dramatic effect.</li>
            </ol>
