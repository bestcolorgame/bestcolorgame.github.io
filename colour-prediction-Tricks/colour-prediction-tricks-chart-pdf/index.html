        <h2>Introduction to Colour Prediction</h2>
        <p>Color prediction is a skill essential in fields ranging from fashion design and interior decorating to digital media and art.

        <h2>Understanding the Color Wheel</h2>
        <p>The color wheel is a fundamental tool in color theory. It shows the relationships between colors and provides a visual representation of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Primary colors are red, blue, and yellow; these colors cannot be made by mixing other colors. Secondary colors such as orange, green, and purple, are created by mixing two primary colors. Tertiary colors result from the combination of a primary and a secondary color.</p>

Fashion shows, interior design expos, and art scenes are fertile grounds for spotting upcoming colors. Additionally, color forecasting agencies like Pantone release yearly colors that influence various industries.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Comparing past charts with current trends to assess accuracy.</li>
            <li>Analyzing colors according to industries since what may be popular in fashion may not be in home decor.</li>
            <li>Paying attention to complementary colors that might appeal to the market.</li>
        </ul>
