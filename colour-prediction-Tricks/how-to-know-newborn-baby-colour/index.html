    <h1>Understanding Newborn Skin Color Changes</h1>
</header>
<article>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many new parents are curious about how to predict or understand the skin color of their newborn baby. It's important to note that the skin color of newborns can change over time due to various factors including genetic makeup and health conditions.</p>

    <h2>Initial Appearance</h2>
    <p>When babies are first born, their skin might not have its final color yet. This is because the skin can take some time after birth to display its natural pigment. Initially, many babies, especially those born earlier, might appear lighter due to the thick layer of vernix that covers their skin. Others might look red or purple, which is normal immediately after delivery.</p>

    <h2>Changes Over Time</h2>
    <p>Baby's skin color can change significantly during the first few hours and days. Exposure to air and the first few breaths lead to changes in skin color from the initial red, turning more into their natural skin tone. Moreover, the breakdown of excess red blood cells makes some newborns develop a yellowish tint, known as jaundice, which usually resolves itself or with medical treatment.</p>

    <h2>Genetic Factors</h2>
    <p>The most significant determinant of a baby's skin color is genetics. Every person inherits genes from both their parents, and these genes contribute to the development of their skin color. Typically, babies inherit a mix of skin color traits from their parents, and thus their final skin tone can be a variety of shades. Predicting the exact shade just after birth can therefore be difficult.</p>

    <h2>When Skin Color Settles</h2>
    <p>It can take up to six months for a baby's skin color to settle into its permanent shade. However, it’s important to understand that slight changes can continue to occur as the child grows. An infant's skin is also affected by external factors such as sun exposure and health conditions.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Ultimately, a newborn's initial skin color may be a temporary hue, with genetics and external factors influencing changes over time. Patience is key, as the exact shade will reveal itself naturally.</p>
