        <h2>Understand the Basics of Color Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Before diving into sophisticated tools like ColorWiz, a solid understanding of color theory can be incredibly beneficial. Recognizing the relationships between different colors and understanding concepts such as complementary, analogous, and triadic color schemes can serve as the foundation for using color more effectively.

        <h2>Utilize ColorWiz’s Palette Generator</h2>
        <p>
            One of the standout features of ColorWiz is its palette generator. Here are some tips on how you can use this feature to great effect:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with a Base Color:</strong> Choose a primary color that reflects the mood you want to set. ColorWiz can generate additional colors that harmonize well with your choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the Palette:</strong> Flexibility is key. Use the tool to darken, lighten, or adjust the saturation of the colors depending on the requirements of your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Vary the Number of Colors:</strong> Different projects require different complexities in color schemes. Experiment with adding more colors or reducing the number to simplify your design.</li>
