    <h1>Discovering the Best Colors for You</h1>
</header>
<section class="content">
    <p>Finding the right colors to wear can enhance your appearance, boost your confidence, and even influence how others perceive you. But how do you know which colors are your best colors? Here's a guide to help you determine which hues complement you the most, based on your skin tone, eye color, and hair color.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Understand Your Skin Undertone</h2>
        <p>Your skin's undertone is the key to figuring out which colors suit you best. There are generally three undertones: cool, warm, and neutral.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Look for hints of blue, pink, or rosy-red hues in your skin. Silver jewelry typically looks better on you than gold.</li>
            <li><strong>Warm:</strong> Your skin will lean towards peachy, yellow, or golden tones. Gold jewelry suits you more than silver.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> You might notice a mix of both warm and cool hues, or your skin tone might be the same as your actual skin color. Both gold and silver jewelry look good on you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To determine your undertone, look at the veins on your wrist under natural light. If they appear blue or purple, you likely have a cool undertone. If they appear greenish, you have a warm undertone. If it’s hard to tell, you probably have a neutral undertone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Choosing Colors Based on Your Undertone</h2>
        <p>Once you know your undertone, choosing flattering colors gets easier.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cool Undertones:</strong> Opt for colors like blue, purple, emerald green, and lavender. Avoid most earth tones which might make you look washed out.</li>
            <li><strong>Warm Undertones:</strong> Stick with earth tones like reds, oranges, yellows, and olive green. Cool pastels may not complement you as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral Undertones:</strong> You have the flexibility to wear colors from both cool and warm spectrums. However, muted shades often look more harmonious than vibrant ones.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Factor In Your Hair and Eye Color</h2>
        <p>Your hair and eye color can also influence which colors look best on you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dark Hair and Eyes:</strong> You might look stunning in jewel tones like sapphire blue or emerald green.</li>
            <li><strong>Light Hair and Eyes:</strong> Soft pastels and muted colors can beautifully highlight your features.</li>
            <li><strong>Bright Eyes:</strong> Wearing a top that matches your eye color can make your eyes pop and look more vibrant.</li>
        
    </ul></div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Experiment and Observe</h2>
        <p>The best way to find your colors is by experimenting and observing how certain colors affect your appearance. Notice how you feel and how others react when you wear certain colors.</p>
