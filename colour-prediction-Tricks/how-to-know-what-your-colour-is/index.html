    <h1>Discovering Your Personal Color Palette</h1>
    <p>Everyone has a unique set of colors that enhances their natural beauty, often aligned with their skin tone, eye, and hair color. Finding these can enhance your style, make your wardrobe choices easier, and even boost your confidence. Here's how you can discover your personal color palette.</p>
    
    <h2>Understand Your Skin's Undertone</h2>
    <p>Your skin's undertone is the color underneath the surface. You can have a cool, warm, or neutral undertone. Determining your undertone is the first step in identifying your color palette.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cool undertones:</strong> Your skin may have hints of blue, pink, or a ruddy complexion.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm undertones:</strong> Your skin might show yellow, peachy, golden, or olive hues.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral undertones:</strong> You may not notice any obvious overtones of pink or sallow skin but a mix of both warm and cool tones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Warm or Cool?</h2>
    <p>Knowing whether you're better suited to warm or cool colors can be pivotal. Here are a few tests you can do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Vein Test:</strong> Look at the veins on your inner wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you likely lean towards cool tones. If they look greenish, you're warm-toned.</li>
        <li><strong>The Jewelry Test:</strong> Do you look better in silver, or does gold highlight your features more strikingly? If it's the former, you likely have a cool undertone. If it's the latter, warm tones are for you.</li>
        <li><strong>The White Fabric Test:</strong> Hold a pure white fabric up to your face. Does it make your skin look glowy or washed out? If you glow, you're probably warm-toned. If you look washed out, cool tones are your go-to.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Finding Your Season</h2>
    <p>Color analysts often use the concept of seasons to describe how certain colors reflect on individuals based on their natural coloring:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring and Autumn:</strong> These seasons favor warm tones. Springs are typically clear and light, while Autumns are deeper and richer.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer and Winter:</strong> Summer and Winter people look best in cool tones. Summers are generally muted and soft, while Winters are bold and intense.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trial and Error</h2>
    <p>The final and fun part is to experiment with colors. Try on various clothing colors and see which make your face light up, which ones drown you out, and which ones amplify your natural tones.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
