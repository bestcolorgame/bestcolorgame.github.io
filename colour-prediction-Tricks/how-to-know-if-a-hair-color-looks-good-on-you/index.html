<h1>How to Determine If a Hair Color Suits You</h1>
</header>
<section>
<p>Choosing a new hair color can be exciting and transformative, but how do you know what will look good on you? Whether you're contemplating a subtle change or a radical makeover, selecting the right hair color is key to enhancing your appearance. Below, we explore several factors and tips to help you make the best choice.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>1. Consider Your Skin Tone</h2>
<img src="/images/colorGame/Snipaste_2024-05-14_21-25-59.png" alt="Skin Tone Chart" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
<p>The most important factor in determining what hair color looks good on you is your skin tone. Hair colors should complement your skin's undertones—warm, cool, or neutral. Here’s a quick guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm skin tones</strong> (peachy, golden, or yellow undertones) look best with warm hair colors like golden blonde, rich honey brown, and copper-red.</li>
<li><strong>Cool skin tones</strong> (pink, red or bluish undertones) shine with cool hair colors such as platinum, ash blonde, ash brown, and cool dark browns.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral skin tones</strong> (a mix of warm and cool undertones) can often pull off both warm and cool hair colors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Eye Color Matters</h2>

<p>Your eye color can also serve as a guide for choosing your hair color. Certain hair colors can make your eye color pop or appear more vivid.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue eyes</strong> sometimes look striking with dark browns or platinum blonde.</li>
<li><strong>Green eyes</strong> are enhanced by reds and warm browns.</li>
<li><strong>Brown eyes</strong> can be warmed up with caramels and rich chestnut tones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Current Hair Color and Condition</h2>
<p>Your current hair color and its condition can influence what colors will be easiest to achieve and maintain. If your hair is heavily processed or damaged, certain colors may be more difficult to maintain or achieve without further damage.</p>

<h2>4. Maintenance and Commitment</h2>
<p>Some hair colors require more maintenance than others. Be realistic about how much time and money you want to spend on upkeep. Pastel colors, platinum blonde, and vivid hues might require frequent salon visits to keep looking fresh.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>5. Consult with a Professional</h2>
<p>Before making a decision, it’s always best to consult with a hair professional. They can provide personalized advice based on your hair type, condition, and what you want to achieve. They may even suggest temporary solutions like semi-permanent dye or highlights, which can give you a new look without long-term commitment.</p>

<h2>6. Use a Virtual Hair Color Tool</h2>
