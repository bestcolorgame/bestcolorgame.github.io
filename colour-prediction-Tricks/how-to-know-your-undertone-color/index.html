## How to Determine Your Skin Undertone

Understanding your skin undertone is crucial for choosing the right makeup colors, clothing, and jewelry that complement your natural palette. Undertones are categorized into three main types: warm, cool, and neutral.

### What is a Skin Undertone?

Unlike your skin tone, which is the shade of your skin, undertones are the colors underneath the surface. You might have the same skin color as someone else but different undertones.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Undertone

#### 1. **The Vein Test**
   Look at the veins on your wrist. If they appear:
   - Greenish, you likely have a warm undertone.
   - Blue or purple, you probably have a cool undertone.
   - A mix of both, or if it’s hard to tell, you might have a neutral undertone.

   **Image Suggestion:** A close-up of wrists showcasing different vein colors.

#### 2. **The White Fabric Test**
   Hold a piece of pure white fabric under your face and observe how your skin looks in comparison. If your skin appears:
   - Yellowish or golden, your undertone is warm.
   - Pink, rosy, or bluish, your undertone is cool.
   - No significant change, you likely have a neutral undertone.

   **Image Suggestion:** People holding white fabric under their chin in different lighting.

#### 3. **The Sun Reaction Test**
   How does your skin react to the sun? If you:
   - Tan easily and rarely burn, you probably have a warm undertone.
   - Burn easily and tan minimally, you likely have a cool undertone.
   - Tan sometimes, but can also burn, you might have a neutral undertone.

   **Image Suggestion:** A collage showing different reactions to sun exposure.

#### 4. **The Jewelry Test**
   Silver and platinum flatter cool undertones, while gold enhances warm undertones. If both look equally good on you, you might have a neutral undertone.

   **Image Suggestion:** Individuals wearing gold and silver jewelry.

#### 5. **The Color Test**
   Try on different colored clothes near your face and observe which colors make you look brighter and more energized:
   - Warm undertones look best in earth tones like red, orange, yellow, and olive green.
   - Cool undertones are complemented by colors such as blue, purple, and emerald green.
   - Neutral undertones can wear shades from both cool and warm palettes effectively.

   **Image Suggestion:** People wearing a variety of colors based on their undertone.

### Closing Thoughts

Identifying your undertone can enhance your appearance by enabling you to select colors that naturally complement you. If you’re still unsure about your undertone after these tests, consider consulting with a professional makeup artist or a stylist. They can provide a more personalized analysis based on their experience.
