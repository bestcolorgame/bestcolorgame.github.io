<h1>Understanding Hair Color</h1>
<p>Hair color is a fascinating subject, combining genetics, biology, and fashion. The color of human hair is determined by two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. The balance and concentration of these pigments, influenced by genetic factors, result in the wide spectrum of human hair colors.</p>

<h2>Types of Hair Color</h2>
<p>Typically, hair colors are broken down into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black:</strong> Rich in eumelanin, black is the darkest hair color. It is predominant in Asia and Africa.</li>
<li><strong>Brown:</strong> This is the most common hair color worldwide. Varying concentrations of eumelanin can result in different shades of brown hair.</li>
<li><strong>Blonde:</strong> Blonde hair has low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin and higher amounts of pheomelanin. It ranges from pale blonde to dark gold and is most commonly found in Northern Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Red:</strong> Characterized by its high levels of pheomelanin and low levels of eumelanin. Red hair is rare and accounts for only around 1-2% of the world's population.</li>
<li><strong>Grey or White:</strong> Hair becomes grey or white due to the decrease in melanin production with age, which leads to hair no longer holding its original, darker color.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Genetics of Hair Color</h2>
<p>The genetics of hair color are complex with many genes involved. The MC1R gene plays a key role in determining whether hair is red or not. Other genes, such as OCA2, impact the shades of brown, blonde, and black hair.</p>

<h2>Changing Hair Color</h2>
<p>Many people change their hair color using hair dyes. There are three main types of hair dyes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary:</strong> Coats the surface of the hair and washes out after a few shampoos.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-permanent:</strong> Lasts through several washes, typically 5-12 shampoos.</li>
<li><strong>Permanent:</strong> Changes hair color permanently until new hair grows in. It changes the natural pigment by chemical reactions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Caring for Colored Hair</h2>
<p>Colored hair needs special care:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shampoo Less Frequently:</strong> To prevent color from fading, reduce the frequency of shampooing and use products designed for color-treated hair.</li>
<li><strong>Condition Regularly:</strong> Colored hair tends to dry out faster. Using conditioner helps to keep it hydrated and protects the color.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid High Heat:</strong> High temperatures from hair dryers, curling irons, or straighteners can damage colored hair. Use heat-protectant products and minimize the use of high heat tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding your hair's natural color can help you make informed decisions about dyeing your hair and maintaining its health. Whether you're sporting your natural shade or experimenting with new colors, taking proper care of your hair is crucial.</p>
